Okay next, let's talk about the various types
of application attacks.
So first off, we have replay attacks.
And a replay attack is very much
what we talked about before.
It's basically a man-in-the-middle attack.
So it's sniffing the wired or a wireless network.
And again, using something like Wireshark
or some type of packet sniffing software,
the replay attack captures packets
and then puts them back on the wire.
So packets can potentially be modified
and retransmitted to look like legitimate packets.
So sequencing helps to mitigate the effectiveness
of this type of attack to make sure
that they arrive in the sequence
in which they were transmitted.
So in essence, it's the way of configuring transmissions
so that some additional information
or sequencing information is passed along with the packets.
So as an example, here we have Bob and Alice, shocker.
These two are constantly talking, chatter bugs.
So they're talking over the internet or over the network.
They think they're having a private communication
between the two of them, but lo and behold,
here we have our attacker.
He comes in and he uses, again, a wire sniffing tool,
and he's actually intercepting the packets
that Bob is passing along,
and then he is replaying them back to Alice.
So he's either just eavesdropping on the communication
or he's potentially manipulating
or somehow changing the data as it passes on to Alice.
And then of course, as she replies back
and then he replies back to Bob, they are none the wiser.
They think they're having any communication
between themselves, but in reality,
we have the attacker here capturing those packets
and then replaying them on the network.
