Next, let's talk a little more
about Endpoint Detection and Response, or EDR.
So some of the key features are:
the ability to monitor and collect activity
from various endpoints,
so we can kinda see what's going on throughout the network.
So it can analyze that data to identify threats,
patterns, or indicators of compromise, right, IOCs.
It can automatically respond to identified threats
to remove or potentially mitigate them,
notify appropriate teams.
We can kick off forensics and analysis tools
to research threats and also search
for suspicious activities.
So you can see, it does a lotta the same things
that a SOAR system would do,
but in the previous context, this EDR endpoint
would actually feed into a larger SOAR system,
which is more robust and has the ability to integrate
with a lot of other systems and so forth.
