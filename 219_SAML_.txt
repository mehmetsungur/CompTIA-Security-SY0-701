Okay, let's go ahead
and take a look at SAML in a bit more detail
and just in a different view.
So again, Security Assertion Markup Language,
and it's basically authenticating
through a third party to gain access.
So just understand that the resource being accessed
is not responsible for the authentication.
So that authentication request is passed
to a trusted third-party server, or in this case, the IdP.
So the user authenticates to the third-party server.
The token is issued, or a token is issued,
which is then passed to the target resource.
And then we have the IdP
or the Authentication Service Server.
So here we have kind of our swim lanes,
and we're gonna have our client
that basically the user accesses the resource server
via some URL, right?
It's a web-based application
that basically sends an HTTP post
to the authentication server or the IdP
with the authentication request.
The user is sent a login page
to the AS if they're not already logged in.
If they are, then they can skip that part.
The user logs in.
The SAML token is issued
with the authentication that's sent to the resource server
or the service provider,
and then that user is logged in to the resource server,
to the web application, in other words.
