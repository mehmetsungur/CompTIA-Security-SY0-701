A quick demo
utilizing one of the Pluralsight labs
on reporting and prioritizing vulnerabilities,
and this actually uses the Metasploit framework
that I talked about before.
So if you visit Pluralsight's website,
do a quick search for that lab,
you'll find getting started in the environment.
You'll go ahead and click start lab.
It would then take a few moments
and create the environment for you,
which you can then log into remotely via your web browser.
So you see here I have an environment opened up,
and I'm gonna open up two terminal windows,
one of which I'm gonna run the Metasploit framework.
Another one I'm gonna run TCPDump,
which is a packet capture.
But on the left hand side here, I'll type in MSF console
to start up the Metasploit framework console.
I run TCPDump, and I give it a few parameters
to specify what I wanted to capture.
And then back on the left hand side, I create a database
for the output of our Metasploit scans,
basically telling you what network to map.
And again, these are all instructions
that are step by step in the lab.
So I'm skipping through some of these things
just to give you a quick overview
of how the lab's progressed.
But as you go through step by step,
you'll get a great understanding of how to use these tools
with some hands-on activities.
So you can see on the right hand side,
now that I've kicked off that script,
it's actually scanning the network and TCPDump.
You can see the activity on the right hand side
showing all the packet captures that are taking place.
And when it's done,
you see I have over 3,000 packet captures.
Back in the left hand window, I type hosts,
which queries the database and comes back
and shows me the two hosts that it found on that network.
I can then add some additional parameters
by specifying -C
and then specifying which columns I wanna show,
which makes it just a little bit easier to read.
And I can do the same thing for services
and show what services are running on those hosts.
And again, I can choose to display certain columns
again to make it easier to read,
but all the information that it's reporting back
gives me ideas of what vulnerabilities might exist
and what tools or what scripts
I can run against those services or those hosts
to potentially exploit those vulnerabilities.
Again, much more detail in the hands-on lab.
So I encourage you to check this one out
along with the other labs in the Pluralsight catalog.
But as you can see, by specifying services-C,
I pick which columns to look at.
And then I do the same thing with notes,
which gives me additional information about each host
and the services running on those hosts.
And you can see, if I zoom in here,
the one that I'm really interested in is the one host,
as you can see, actually has anonymous FTP running,
which happens to be
a potential vulnerability that we could exploit.
So just a quick demo, in the interest of time,
I'm not gonna go through step by step,
but I definitely encourage you
to check out these labs and more.
It's invaluable hands-on experience,
and helps to solidify the concepts you learn in this course
and other courses throughout the catalog.
