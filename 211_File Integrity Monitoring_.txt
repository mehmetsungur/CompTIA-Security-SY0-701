Next we have file integrity monitoring.
So this is detecting changes
in critical operating system files or application files,
so it could be indicative of a breach or some anomaly.
And to really get a handle on things, we create a baseline
to understand what good looks like,
and we're talking about file sizes, permissions, timestamps,
hash values, and so forth.
And then periodically schedule scanning
of those critical files to make sure that nothing's changed.
So change detection, again, modification, deletion,
or a new file creation in these critical file spaces,
these critical file locations,
if any of these things take place,
then we will alert and report.
And again, this might be due to regulatory compliance
or just because we wanna understand
what's happening in our environment.
But understand, we're not monitoring
for every single file on a server.
That'd be way too many, and things change way too often.
We're looking at what is critical
at the operating system level and at the application level
to understand if a hacker tries to insert processes,
change things, start to encrypt data,
start to encrypt files, and so forth,
we can get alerted
and understand what's happening very quickly.
