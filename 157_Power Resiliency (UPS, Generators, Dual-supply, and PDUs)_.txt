And then lastly,
let's talk about power resiliency.
So an uninterruptible power supply, or a UPS,
is a battery backup that provides power
in the event of disruption,
whether that's a sag or an outage, et cetera,
so the length of time that system stays up
depends upon the type of UPS, the batteries, and so forth.
Next, we have a generator.
So it's an alternate power supply
that typically runs on gas
and will quickly turn on if a power dip
or an outage is detected.
And then we have dual supply,
so power is supplied by dual feeds
independent of one another,
so you may have an A side and a B side,
you would actually have two different power sources
coming into a data center,
so if one were to go down, you have a backup.
And then also managed power distribution units, or PDUs.
So this provides the ability to monitor and control
critical factors such as voltage, current,
the power factor, and so forth,
and I just have a quick example here
of what A PDU would look like.
They can be rack-mounted, they could be sitting on a desk.
Again, it just depends upon the environment.
But as the name implies,
they are a power distribution unit
and they allow cleaning of power,
and they can send alerts to administrators
or to battery backup devices
if anomalies are detected and so forth.
Okay, so we made it to the end of the module
and the end of the course.
Lots of good information in there, pretty jam-packed,
so stick around because up next we have the Domain Summary.
