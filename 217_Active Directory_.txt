So in most environments,
we'll have Active Directory in some form on the backend,
providing our user database
and accounts management and so forth.
So just a quick primer on Active Directory,
just for own information.
Active Directory was introduced in 2000,
so it's old enough to drink in most countries.
In 2003, they added the ability to change the position
of domains within an AD forest.
In 2008, introduced AD Federated Services
or ADFS rebranded Active Directory
or ADDS Active Directory Directory Services,
and then read only domain controllers
or RODCs used quite a bit in branch offices
and remote offices, and then in 2016 released Azure AD
to enable the joining of on-prem Active Directory
with Azure Active Directory.
Also enable single sign-on for MS cloud services
like Office 365
and PAM are privileged Access Management.
And then 2022 deployed ADFS and Azure,
Hardware Based Adaptation,
and Azure AD as an identity provider.
So just some of the major milestones over the past 20 years
or so for Active Directory.
There's obviously a lot more,
but these are some of the highlights.
So I say all of that to give you a
primer just on Federation.
So Federation basically allowing access to company resources
to outside parties.
So trusted third parties authenticate a
client, a host or a user.
Social media services like Facebook
and Twitter, also LinkedIn and Google
all provide Federation services
and more than likely you've seen them
or use them when you're logging into different services
and different websites and so forth.
