Next, we have network access control or NAC.
So this refers to a set of policies
that define a minimal set of requirements
that each device must have
before being allowed on the network.
So such things as antivirus installed and up to date,
certain OS levels and patch levels,
and then applications.
Making sure they have certain applications
or making sure they don't have certain applications.
Again, we can whitelist or blacklist.
So, again, this is becoming more and more important
as BYOD becomes more and more prevalent.
So a few examples of some of these things
might be good messaging.
We have Mobile Iron, and then we also have Workspace ONE,
which was formerly VMware AirWatch.
So when it comes to actually
how we set up network access control,
a few things to keep in mind here.
We have a permanent agent,
so that's a persistent agent
that's installed on the host device
and it runs continuously.
Next, we have a dissolvable or a temporary agent.
So that's an agent that's run from a portal.
So a user downloads the agent,
it runs once, and then it disappears.
We have agentless NAC,
which is embedded within an Active Directory as an example.
So that network access control code verifies
the host complies with access policy,
and that's typically with a domain join
or a logon or logoff.
And then we have a mobile network access control
or Mobile NAC,
specifically designed for mobile devices.
They enforce security policies on smartphones and tablets.
BYOD, as we talked about,
is making this more and more critical.
