Next we have worms,
and a worm is a self-replicating program
that is usually self-contained
and can execute and spread without user interaction.
That's the difference between
what we just talked about before.
So here, worms spread without any user interaction.
So they can spread very, very quickly throughout a network.
And there are two main types of worms.
So we have network service worms,
which exploit network vulnerabilities
to propagate and infect others.
And then we also have mass mailing worms,
which exploit email systems to spread and infect others.
