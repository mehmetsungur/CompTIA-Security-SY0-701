So if we look at the threat actor attributes,
I put together a matrix that you can go ahead and pause
and look at this at your leisure.
But just to break it down a bit, we have the actor type,
whether it's internal or external,
we have the level of sophistication.
Again, it can go from low to high.
Also, the resources and funding,
and the intent and motivation.
Nation states, as an example,
intent motivation is typically espionage.
Unskilled attackers, might be just curiosity,
or as a hacktivist or a hacktivist group,
might be ideological.
So I would recommend pausing this kind of looking through,
making sure you understand their skill level
or level of sophistication, along with their funding level.
