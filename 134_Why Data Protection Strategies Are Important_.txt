Hey everybody, welcome back to Pluralsight.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees,
and in this module, we'll be talking about concepts
and strategies to protect data.
So let's take a look at what we'll cover in this module.
We have four major categories.
We have data types, data classifications,
general data considerations,
and then methods to secure data.
And as always, we'll take a little bit deeper look
behind the covers, and pause here for just a second.
You can look at what we'll cover in more detail.
And then when you're ready, let's go ahead and get started.
Okay, so basically, why is this important?
Data classification doesn't sound all that glamorous,
(chuckles) quite frankly,
and it's a little bit on the dry side,
but the reality is it's extremely important.
So it's important that you follow through this module
and understand the concepts in here,
because ensuring that data is classified correctly,
handled appropriately,
and protected against theft or misuse is critical.
It's really absolutely critical
to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability.
Remember the CIA triad that we talked about previously?
It's what all security professionals are trying
to make sure they accomplish.
It's critical to an organization's data.
So some of the potential risks if we don't do this properly
are data exposure.
It could be leaked out to the public,
it could be stolen or exfiltrated.
We could have compliance violations,
which could have some pretty significant financial
implications attached to that.
We may have insufficient incident response
because we're not identifying the risk early enough,
or we don't understand the ramifications
or the downstream impacts.
It could be, as I mentioned, loss of revenue.
And then most importantly, it could be loss of trust
and or investor and consumer confidence,
which is pretty much the lifeblood of any company.
