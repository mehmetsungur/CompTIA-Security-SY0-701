And then a few more concepts
I wanna make sure you're aware of.
We have non persistence snapshots and then live boot media.
So non-persistent.
So this prevents people from customizing their desktops,
installing unapproved applications,
tweaking settings, and so forth.
So in other words, as an admin,
we give someone a virtual desktop.
They log in, they get the desktop,
they get access to things, but they can't customize.
When they shut that machine down,
and they spin it back up the next day
and they log back in again,
it basically gives them a fresh copy of that desktop.
So if they changed colors, they installed applications,
any of those things that would basically be wiped,
and it would start from scratch.
And then snapshots, we talked about that.
So that allows a user to quickly revert
to a known good state or rollback changes
in the event of a virus, malware, spyware, and so forth.
And then we have live boot media.
So Live Boot Media is basically an operating system
on a USB drive that you would boot up
that allows you to clean a system,
removing malware and so forth,
so you actually boot off of the USB device
instead of the operating system on the computer.
