And then that brings us up
to actually recovering data.
So data retention.
We need to make sure things are properly defined
and actually documented.
So data may need to be retained
or specifically not retained for various reasons.
So compliance, it could be eDiscovery,
it could be data-mining,
customer history, customer experience.
Some companies wanna keep everything forever.
Some wanna keep it for X number of years.
Some don't wanna keep it for very long at all.
So that way they don't have things
that could be brought up in an eDiscovery scenario.
So, again, every business is gonna be different
and the industry that you're in
will also dictate some of that
'cause there may be compliance and regulation issues.
So the longer data is retained, as you can imagine,
the costs and the storage requirements will increase.
Replicating offsite.
A remote data center or a cloud provider
can protect against some things like disaster,
cyber incidents, and so forth.
We talked about replicating to a hot site or a warm site,
or perhaps even a cold site.
So just keep those things in mind.
And then a quick example of data retention.
So here we have a user that's sitting in a primary location,
a primary data center.
So they have data on primary storage
while they can do backups to a secondary storage array.
And that will more than likely be
in the primary data center.
So you're gonna back up to another device
within your same data center,
or it could be a remote data center.
So we could actually back up to a cloud provider,
or we could back up to a remote data center
to help us guard against some type of national disaster
to our primary data center.
