Next, we have the concept of a logic bomb.
So a logic bomb is malicious code that triggers
after a period of time based upon some date
or some specific activity.
So as you can see,
a lot of different types of malicious code here,
all of which have different types of goals.
But at the end of the day, it's disruptive,
it takes a user or a system offline,
or slows down productivity in some form or fashion.
Logic bombs can be put in place
and sit dormant for extended periods of time.
And you always hear tales of employees
who were let go from companies and so forth,
but they planted a logic bomb before they left.
And then months or years after they left, boom, right,
the whole system goes down.
Whether that's true or not,
or actually happens all that often, probably not,
but the concept is there.
And the ability to plant these things
and just sit dormant
until some specific activity takes place is certainly real.
