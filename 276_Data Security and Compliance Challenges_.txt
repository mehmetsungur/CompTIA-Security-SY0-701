There are some additional challenges
around data security.
So when we collect massive amounts
of data from ever increasing sources,
this creates privacy and security challenges obviously.
As I mentioned, big data aggregation
and analysis can create PII from disparate sources.
So in other words, bits and pieces of information that in
and of themselves don't mean anything really.
Don't paint a picture of who that person is.
But when we use things like big data analytics
and pull all of those pieces of the information together,
it can certainly paint a picture of who that person is
and create PII
or personally identifiable information from all
of those disparate sources.
Inadequate data management is another big one, so defining
who owns the data, the data lifecycle,
how long do we keep it along with how it's processed,
analyzed, and secured becomes increasingly more difficult.
And then also insecure infrastructure.
So data environments are often designed for speed
or for scale and not necessarily for security.
As we know in the security world,
security is quite often an afterthought
and a bit of a bolt-on, if you will.
The addition of IOT devices, big data analytics,
and of course cloud or hybrid cloud environments amplify
the challenge and potentials for exposure.
Again, a lot of locks to check,
a lot of doors to shut, windows to close and so forth.
There's more and more things being thrown at us,
so proper process automation, documentation,
all of these things become more and more critical.
