In an era of ever-evolving cyber threats,
organizations are constantly at risk
of financial and reputational damage.
From ransomware attacks to data breaches,
the spectrum of cyber threats is broad
and potentially devastating.
The need for competent, knowledgeable security folks
has never been greater.
So this course provides a deep dive
into the current cyber threat landscape
and also unveils practical strategies
to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities.
By enhancing your understanding
and implementing robust security measures,
you can significantly fortify your organization's defense
against malicious actors.
By understanding the threats that exist
and where they may come from,
you'll be able to make your organization
a much harder target for adversaries.
Hey, everyone.
My name is Christopher Rees, and welcome to my course
Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
for CompTIA Security+.
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include:
types of attackers and their motivations,
goals, and tactics;
common threat vectors and attack surfaces;
also types of vulnerabilities
and how to mitigate against them;
along with indicators of compromise
and the tools used to launch attacks.
By the end of this course,
you'll have the knowledge required to understand and assess
the various threats and vulnerabilities
you're likely to face,
along with the tools and methods to guard against them.
Additionally, you'll be able to articulate those findings
to your peers, to management,
and also to partner organizations.
But before beginning this course, you should be familiar
with general IT and computer concepts.
So I hope you'll join me on this journey
and learn to identify the threats,
both internally and externally, that all companies face
with the Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations course
for CompTIA Security+ here at Pluralsight.
