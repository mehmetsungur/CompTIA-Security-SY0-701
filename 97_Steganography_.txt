Next, let's talk about the concept
of steganography.
So it's similar in concept to a Trojan horse
in that data is hidden inside of other data.
So that can be messages or files
that can be hidden inside of pictures
or other types of data.
The challenge with steganography,
it's very difficult to detect,
because we're kind of sprinkling in a file
inside of another file,
especially things that have a lot of white space,
like pictures and images,
where you can have some other kind of junk information
in there and it doesn't really affect
the actual quality of the picture.
Well, we can embed documents inside of those pictures.
It becomes very difficult to detect,
but a bloated file size could be an indicator
that something's not right here.
And just understand
that there are a number of different programs out there
that can be used to embed pictures or data or whatever
inside of other files,
and I'll include a reference to that
in the additional slide deck.
