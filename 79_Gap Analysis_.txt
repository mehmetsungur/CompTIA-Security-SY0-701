Next, let's talk about
the concept of gap analysis.
So a gap analysis is the process of identifying
and evaluating the discrepancies or the gaps
between an organization's current security measures
and its desired, or its required, security posture.
And the goal of this is to identify vulnerabilities,
weaknesses, and, of course, areas for improvement.
And by doing so, we're enabling the development
of a targeted strategy for enhancing cybersecurity defenses
and reducing the risk of cyber threats and attacks.
To use the analogy we talked about before, right,
the perimeter of a building.
You could walk around the outside of your house
or the outside of your business
and look at the windows, the doors, the locks, and so forth,
and you can notice, hey, the doors have three locks on them,
the windows have these locks,
but the window around the side is broken,
or it has no locks, or it's wide open
while you're identifying gaps in that defense.
Same thing happens when we're talking about a network.
Obviously, we're switching those things out
for networking components, servers, and so forth,
but we can look at the patch levels, the OS levels.
Are we up to speed?
Are there vulnerabilities that exist
that have not been patched?
Do we not have tools in place to identify vulnerabilities
or to push out patches or updates,
you know, very quickly across the environment?
If we were to have some type of zero day incident, right,
or breach, or a vulnerability that comes out,
we have to patch right away,
do we have tools in place to actually push those patches
across the entire environment?
So if we don't, that would obviously show up
on a gap analysis report,
and we'd have to identify where those risks are,
and then rank them accordingly and see,
okay, where do we wanna invest our time
and resources to fix them?
Right, what's most important down to least important?
