Okay, next up is everyone's favorite topic,
and that's bloatware.
And bloatware is basically pre-installed software
installed on a device that's unnecessary,
it's redundant, and basically it's seldom used.
So it takes up storage space,
it's potentially slowing down system performance,
and then also it can contain adware or spyware,
as we just mentioned, and also introduce vulnerabilities,
because if it's software that we don't need, we never use,
we don't really pay attention to,
then chances are we're not going to update it
or pay much attention to it.
But you've probably noticed bloatware
if you buy a PC from a local electronic store
or order online.
It comes pre-installed with a number of applications
that you don't want.
So typically, I'll go through
and uninstall those right away,
or I'll blow the entire system away
and reinstall the operating system from scratch.
And then, of course, in a corporate environment,
they're gonna blow those away anyway
and install their corporate image,
so it's gonna be typically bloatware-free.
But just understand that it exists, (laughs)
and as you can see by the poor guy here,
it's pretty frustrating, and it slows things down,
and it's unnecessary.
So general advice is to remove applications
that you don't need to help lock down the system
and just generally reduce the attack surface.
