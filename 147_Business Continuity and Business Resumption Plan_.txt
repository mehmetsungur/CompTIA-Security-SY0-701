Next, is business continuity plans.
So these plans deal with resumption
and recovery of business operations
once the initial disruption is contained.
So things like how to begin recovery,
the location of key personnel and resources,
disaster recovery, alternate work locations,
staging areas, and so forth.
Also, needed resources, whether it's supplies, logistics,
and then various interested parties.
And then standardized data collection
and reporting templates, forms, portals, and so forth.
Because again, depending upon the nature of the disaster
or the breach or the incident,
you may need to liaison with law enforcement,
with your PR folks, with news outlets, and so forth.
And then we have business resumption plans.
So this can be the same
or part of the business continuity plan.
So defines who owns the resumption process,
which, again, may be different
than the personnel responsible
for incident management or disaster recovery,
and the process for determining replacement
of staff, buildings, infrastructure, services, and so forth.
So it depends upon the nature of the incident and damage.
So as an example, do you have temporary folks
that you can bring in as needed
if your disaster recovery area
is in another part of the country,
but there's no folks local with the skill sets needed
to actually house or staff that specific data center?
Well, then it might be an issue.
They might be able to work remotely.
But again, that should all be defined ahead of time.
It's not the time in the middle of the crisis
to find these things out.
