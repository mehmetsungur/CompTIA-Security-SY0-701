And then lastly,
we have new threats and zero days.
So governments and nation states,
we have organized crime groups and hacking groups,
and then we have hacktivists or script kiddies
or unskilled attackers as they're called nowadays.
So understand that zero days kind of range
depending upon who's using them.
So we have a very sophisticated
and very expensive all the way down
to very unsophisticated and inexpensive.
And when I say zero day, I mean a vulnerability
that's been discovered that there is no fix for.
Some of these zero days are extremely valuable.
They're extremely complex.
Governments, nation states, hacking groups,
like very, very skilled hacking groups
will hoard these things
and put them in their toolbox, if you will.
So these things are sold on the dark web,
some for millions of dollars.
They're very, very complicated
and a lot of nations will, will hoard these
and not actually issue a fix for them.
They will not let people know that they exist,
but they keep them for themselves
if and when they need to use them.
Organized crime and hacking groups
kind of somewhere in the middle.
And then you have, like I said, hacktivists
and the unskilled actors who are on the lower,
more unsophisticated side as far as expense
and sophistication goes,
but the general premise remains.
But zero days are extremely problematic
because they exist obviously,
and there are typically no fixes for them.
It may be hours, days, weeks, sometimes months
before a fix is created
and a patch is pushed out to the general public,
and in that meantime, there could be hundreds or thousands
or tens of thousands or millions of hosts that are infected
and impacted by those vulnerabilities.
Okay, so that wraps up this module.
We talked about the various types of vulnerabilities.
I hope you found this module informative.
So please stick around because next we'll be talking about
analyzing the indicators of malicious activity.
So I'll see you in the next module.
