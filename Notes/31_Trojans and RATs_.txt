Next we have the concept of Trojan.
We talked about that briefly before,
but a Trojan is malicious software
that disguises itself as legitimate software.
And basically we're looking to gain access
to a target system to steal data, disrupt operations,
or enable unauthorized remote control.
Now, key takeaway is that Trojans
do not self-replicate and they rely on user interaction.
So just for awareness, the top 10 malware or RATs,
which is a remote access Trojan
is Qbot, Formbook, And I won't read through all of these,
but I'll put these out here just for you to take a look
and understand that this is just a handful of the many,
many RATs or remote access Trojans that exist.
But it definitely would be in your best interest
to do a little bit of research on each of these,
just to understand what they are,
how they are implemented,
and of course, how to mitigate against them.
