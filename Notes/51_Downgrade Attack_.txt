Okay, next,
let's look at cryptographic attacks.
And the first one up is something referred to
as a downgrade attack.
So, this is an attack that forces a system to negotiate down
to a lower-quality method of communication.
So, basically, it allows an attacker to force a lower-grade
or less secure method of communication.
And you may wonder why is that even possible?
Why should you be able to downgrade?
Well, remember, as the IT environments constantly evolve,
we're constantly upgrading systems,
that upgrading doesn't happen across the board
with every single system,
so we always have to maintain some level
of backwards compatibility
so we can communicate with older systems
or, quote, unquote, legacy systems.
So, normally when two systems try to communicate,
they try to agree upon the highest level of communication.
So, if they're both brand new systems or relatively new
and they're using the latest,
greatest communication protocols or encryption protocols,
then all is good,
but if one system needs to communicate with an older system,
it may need to downgrade to a lower level of communication.
And of course, hackers can leverage this.
So we often see this used with man-in-the-middle attacks,
where a hacker will try to force a downgrade
to a less secure communication method
or a less secure encryption method
so it becomes easier to break.
