All right, so let's take a look
at an IdP example.
So here, we have good old Alice,
and Alice is a bit lonely today.
Bob is not around, I'm not sure where he's at.
He's probably getting scammed by some internet hacker
right now via social engineering, knowing Bob,
but anyway, we'll focus on Alice today,
and so Alice wants to log into a ticketing application.
Let's say it's a ticketing application for her work,
and it is perhaps cloud-based or uses an IdP,
or an identity provider.
So she's going to attempt to access that application,
it's gonna realize that she's not currently signed on,
so what it does is then goes out to an SSO provider,
or a single sign-on provider,
and it will issue a request and say, hey, can you let me in?
Well, the single sign-on provider also realizes,
hey, she's not logged in, I can't authenticate her yet,
so it's gonna prompt her to log into that application.
It will then send her an SMS code,
a username and password along with an SMS code,
so it's gonna be a two-factor authentication.
Once Alice provides that information,
it sends it back to the SSO provider,
who then will query an IdP.
It'll issue what's called a SAML request to the IdP.
So a SAML request is a Security Assertion Markup Language,
and it's a standardized way to tell external applications
and services that a user is who they say they are.
It doesn't authorize, but it authenticates.
So it sends that SAML request to the IdP.
The IdP will then authenticate,
send that SAML response back to the SSO provider,
or the single sign-on provider,
who in turn then sends that SAML assertion
back to the ticketing application and saying,
yes, Alice is who she says she is.
Go ahead and let her log into the application.
