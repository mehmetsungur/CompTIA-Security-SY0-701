Next, we have SQL injection.
Now, SQL or Structured Query Language
is how we interact with and program databases,
sorry, how we actually query a database
and get data back out of that database.
So modifying a SQL query that's passed to a web application,
a SQL server and so forth.
So adding code into a data stream.
By using specially crafted SQL queries,
we can bypass login screens
and vulnerable websites can also return usernames,
passwords and so forth
with the right SQL injection technique used.
And we'll do a quick demo of that in just a moment.
And in doing so, we can cause an application
to throw an error and crash,
basically allowing an attacker
remote access to that web server
or at least access to information from within that server.
Again, usernames, passwords, credit card information
if it's not stored properly and so forth.
