So as mentioned,
we have lots of data coming in
from lots and lots of different sources.
So storing all of that data,
whether it's application performance monitoring
or incident handling,
so we can go back and look historically if need be,
recognize trends, and so forth.
Many data aggregation platforms store data
in various types of "buckets" in air quotes.
So basically things like a hot bucket, a warm bucket,
a cold bucket, and then a frozen bucket.
So, as you might guess,
a hot bucket is the fastest, it's the most expensive.
It's data that's pretty much brand new,
maybe minutes or hours old.
And then after a period of time,
it gets moved over to a warm bucket.
It's less expensive, not as fast,
but it's also indexed and searchable.
After a period of time,
and it could be days or weeks or months,
again, depending upon your organization,
that will then get moved over to cold storage,
which is, as you might guess, less expensive.
It's typically very slow,
and depending on the platform, it may or may not be indexed.
It's accessed very, very infrequently.
And then beyond that, and again, it may be many months,
it then gets moved over to a frozen bucket.
And the frozen buckets are typically cloud storage
or offsite storage.
It's immutable, which means it can't be deleted or altered.
It's archived, and it's there for historical purposes.
Lots of times it's there for compliance reasons
and so forth.
Not all data is equal,
and then even data that was equal yesterday
is not necessarily equal today.
It loses importance or relevance over time
and is therefore moved to less expensive tiers of storage.
because again, storage is not endless and it's not free.
So we wanna move things that we don't need
off to cheaper tiers of storage.
