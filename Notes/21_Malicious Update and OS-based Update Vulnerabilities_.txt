Some additional vulnerability considerations.
Alright, malicious updates.
So an attacker manages to compromise
a legitimate software update or a distribution mechanism
to inject malicious code or malware
into a trusted piece of software.
Along those very same lines,
we have operating system based updates
where an attacker compromises the process of delivering,
distributing, or installing operating system updates,
injecting malicious code into a trusted update
for the operating system.
So, very similar to what I just mentioned
with malicious updates,
but now we're talking at the operating system level,
whereas the malicious updates before
were talking about a specific piece of software,
software application, and so forth.
Whereas OS based are coming from a typically,
a trusted source like the operating system vendor.
Let's take a look at a specific attack scenario.
So here we have an attacker
who has their eyes set on a vendor or an OS manufacturer,
and that OS manufacturer has a distribution channel,
which they then push out updates and so forth
to various devices, server, a desktop,
a thin client, laptop, mobile device, what have you.
These devices are expecting to get updates
from a distribution channel,
and they think that that distribution channel
is a trusted source.
That attacker introduces malware
into that vendor or OS manufacturer's infrastructure.
Once compromised, that malicious code then finds its way
into the distribution channel.
From there, as those updates are getting pushed
to the intended targets, which are now victims,
those updates or those malicious updates
get pushed to those target devices as well.
And at this point, they're all compromised,
even though they believe they're getting their updates
from a trusted source.
