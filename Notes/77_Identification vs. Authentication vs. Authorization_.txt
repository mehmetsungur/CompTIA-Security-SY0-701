Okay, so a few more distinctions.
We have identification, versus authentication
versus authorization.
Identification, as the name implies is who you are.
It could be labeling a person via a username,
a security ID, smart card, so on and so forth.
Next we have authentication, so that's proving who you are,
username and password combo, or a PIN
or a one-time password, right OTP,
or biometric data, fingerprint, retina scan, so forth.
And then next authorization, which is basically permissions,
so what you're allowed to access once you're authenticated.
