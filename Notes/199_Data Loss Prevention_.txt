Next, let's talk about data loss prevention,
or DLP. And there's a few things to keep in mind here,
what we basically want to do is reduce the amount
of personal data and sensitive data that leaves our network
and make sure that that data's not stored in places
on the network, that it does not need to be stored.
So we're talking about things like data in use.
So we wanna control data on endpoint devices,
laptops, mobile devices and so forth.
We have data at rest.
So the DLP systems will then discover
sensitive data stored in repos,
repositories on our network,
databases, network stores and so forth.
We're talking about data in motion.
So we will monitor, detect and block,
or at least report, on sensitive data
that's being sent via email as an example.
And again, this can take place also over the network
between endpoints on the network,
so we're gonna monitor and detect
and then enforce encryption and/or at least report
on that data being sent outside of the network
and that also includes out cloud resources as well.
So detect, monitor, delete or encrypt
the use of sensitive data also stored in cloud repositories.
So things like PCIDSS data, HIPAA data,
credit card numbers, personal information,
sensitive information that may fall under
GDPR or CCPA guidelines.
It's imperative that we make sure that that data
is protected properly.
So DLP systems can go out and scour
all these different places on our network
to make sure that data's not sitting in a repository
it's not supposed to be in,
or that it's not traversing the network,
going between two points that it should not be
or worst case, actually leaving the network.
