Also make sure
you have questionnaires developed
so you can gather information from vendors
on their security practices.
So does their application meet certain requirements?
How does it store data?
Is it accessed remotely?
Does it phone home?
Basically meaning calling back to their headquarters,
to their data center, et cetera, et cetera, right?
Some applications, some hardware
need to be remotely monitored and it will issue tickets
or create trouble tickets
or dispatch technicians and so forth.
All of these things should be known
and called out ahead of time.
And then also encryption.
Is it at-rest?
Is it in-transit, in-use, or not at all?
If not, that needs to be highlighted.
And then AI or artificial intelligence integrations.
So does their application now
or will it in the future integrate
some types of AI features?
Copilot as an example.
Does it actually reach out and talk to the Cloud?
Is your data that you're putting into that application
sent to the Cloud for data mining
or perhaps to train the vendor's large language models?
Again, all of these things should be very, very specifically
called out so you understand what you're getting into.
Also, check into their data breach history
and compliance history.
You wanna make sure all of these things line up
with your own security posture.
