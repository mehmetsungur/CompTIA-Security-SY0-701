Okay, so let's also make sure we're aware
of the different types of governance structures.
So we have boards.
So with a board, you may hear the term board of directors,
which is a governing body
that's responsible for the overall corporate governance,
including cybersecurity oversight.
So their responsibilities basically revolve
around setting high-level
cybersecurity policies and strategies,
ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,
and also hold executive management accountable
for cybersecurity.
And then we have committees,
and their role exists often within a board
or an executive management team,
and it focuses on specific aspects
of cybersecurity governance.
Sometimes they're broken up into specific things
like information security committee
or a risk management committee,
and they provide detailed guidance
and recommendations on cybersecurity issues.
Then as you go up in scale,
you have things like government entities.
So government agencies at various levels,
whether it's federal, state, or local,
may establish cybersecurity governance structures
and regulations.
Some of the responsibilities
are defining cybersecurity standards, regulations,
and compliance for any organizations operating
within that specific jurisdiction.
And then just so you're aware, we have centralized
and also decentralized.
So in centralized governance,
cybersecurity decisions and control are concentrated
at a central authority
or a department within a specific organization.
For decentralized governance,
cybersecurity responsibilities are distributed
across various business units or departments.
