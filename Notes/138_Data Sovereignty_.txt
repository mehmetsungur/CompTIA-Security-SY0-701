Something else that's definitely
worth considering you may not have thought of before
is data sovereignty.
So when data is stored electronically,
it is subject to the laws of the country
in which it's located.
So some things we need to ask ourselves is,
who owns the data and who has access?
So if we are a global organization, as an example,
and you have data centers all over the world,
well where those data centers reside,
the country that they're in,
there very well could be some data sovereignty implications.
So it's important to understand that
when you're looking at your environment
and also when you're making decisions
on where to replicate data,
or perhaps where to put in high availability
or fault tolerant data centers.
If it's in a different region
or a different part of the world,
make sure you understand any data sovereignty laws.
So again, who owns the data and who has access?
And then also who can mine the data.
So laws governing data use, access, storage, and deletion
vary from country to country.
