Okay, so let's take a look
at the various types of clouds.
So we have a private cloud,
and that's basically where you manage
and maintain all resources.
So in essence, you manage everything.
You become the provider.
So it could be an IAS, a PaaS, or a SaaS environment.
And then we shift 180 degrees the opposite direction.
We have a public cloud.
So in this model, the public cloud provider
manages the resources, right?
Everything is hosted. You simply control the data.
And then we have a hybrid
where it's basically a mix of public and private,
resources are typically created internal, private,
and then scaled elastically up to the cloud as needed.
Okay? That's a typical way of doing it.
It's not the only way, but that's typically
how hybrid cloud would be used.
And then we have a community version,
which you may or may not see,
and that's basically resources are shared
among several groups, companies, or organizations.
It can be public or private,
but costs are spread across the various members.
So again, kind of a co-op arrangement, if you will.
