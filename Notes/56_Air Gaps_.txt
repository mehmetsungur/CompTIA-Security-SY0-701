And then we have the concept of air gaps.
So an air gap is a method of isolating a computer
or a network from the internet
and also for external networks.
And these things are typically done
or typically seen in instances
where you have critical infrastructure, scatter systems,
which operate critical infrastructure,
nuclear facilities and so forth.
And also highly secure classified networks.
So some advanced techniques can actually
jump air gapped networks.
And these things have been demonstrated.
It's not very easy,
but it's possible in very specific situations.
And we're talking about things,
like emanations and FM frequencies,
where you could literally watch the lights blinking
on a hard drive from across the room or forever,
you have a line of sight and you could potentially read
what's being written to that hard drive.
But again, pretty much a corner case,
not something you would typically see,
but just be aware, in extreme examples,
air gap does not necessarily mean 100% secure.
