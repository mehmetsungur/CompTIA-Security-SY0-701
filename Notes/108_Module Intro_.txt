Hey, everybody.
Welcome back.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees,
and in this course, Security Architecture,
we're gonna be talking specifically
in this module about security implications
of different architecture models.
So as usual, let's go ahead,
and take a look at what we'll cover
in the module.
So we have a few high level topics,
and I pulled a few of the subcategories
just to give you a bit of an overview.
So we have architecture,
and infrastructure concepts,
and that covers things like cloud,
infrastructure as code,
containers and then we have considerations,
things to think about when we're either designing
or assessing these different networks,
and so forth.
Things like availability, resilience and cost.
So as usual,
if you pull back the curtain in a bit,
you'll see we have some additional subtasks
or some subcategories.
So I won't obviously read through all of these,
but we'll go ahead and pause here
for a moment if you like,
so you understand what's coming.
And then when you're ready,
let's go ahead and get started.
