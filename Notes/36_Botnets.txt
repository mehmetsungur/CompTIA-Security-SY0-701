Next, we have botnets.
And a botnet is malicious code that infects a large number
of computers or a large number of hosts for the purpose
of launching large scale attacks on specific targets.
So botnets that sit out on the Internet can be sitting there
for days, weeks, months, perhaps years,
not necessarily doing anything, just waiting for the command
to actually launch into action.
So as we see here, an attacker can be located
anywhere in the world.
We have the concept of a Command and Control Center,
or a C2 or C&amp;C server.
So these C&amp;C servers can control thousands of bots,
sometimes referred to as zombies, for massive DDOS attacks.
So here we have an attacker's PC and then the victim PC
or server, or it could be a website or company at large,
so that attacker's PC would log into
or connect to the Command and Control Server, right,
the C2 server.
And from there, they're able to then control all of the bots
that are spread out across the Internet.
And again, this could be thousands
or potentially even millions of PCs
that once they pull the trigger or give the command,
they then launch a large scale attack
against a single website
or a single group of servers trying to bring that server
or system offline,
basically doing a massive Distributed Denial
of Service attack.
