And then we have an incident management plan,
so these things deal with the initial response
to an incident.
So the tasks, the actions and priorities,
emergency contact details of key personnel
and interested parties,
the activities required as it relates to people,
process, and technology,
contact guidelines, whether it's internal,
media, emergency responders, and so forth,
and then documentation, maps, charts,
perhaps third-party response details, site access info,
and then insurance contact and claim procedures.
So some of these things may seem like they fall out of scope
for a typical security person,
but again, all of these things
are part of a larger business continuity plan.
When disaster strikes,
and disaster could be a natural disaster,
it could be a cyber incident,
you can flick the switch, engage all the right folks,
and hopefully get back up and running
as quickly as possible.
