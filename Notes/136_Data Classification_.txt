Okay, so separate for the types of data,
let's talk about data classification.
So we have sensitive data.
So this is data or information
that requires special handling due to its potential impact
or consequence if disclosed or compromised.
Next, we have confidential information,
and this is information that is legally
or ethically restricted from disclosure
to unauthorized individuals or entities, and then public.
So public information is as the name implies,
it's intentionally made accessible to anyone
and does not require protection or restrictions.
And then we have restricted data.
So data with limited access granted
only to authorized individuals
or groups based upon specific criteria.
Private, which is information intended
for a specific audience or a restricted set of individuals
and not for public consumption.
And then critical, so data systems or assets
that are essential to an organization's operations
and require the highest level
of protection and availability.
So again, I say all these things to make sure
that you understand the distinction,
how they're supposed to be handled,
and you may or may not have all of these classifications
within your organization, but number one for the exam,
you need to understand what these things are.
But more importantly, you need to make sure
that data is classified properly within your organization.
Now, depending upon the size of the organization,
that could be a massive undertaking,
especially if you've gone through years and years of growth
and expansion and so forth.
And that data's never been really properly classified.
To try to go in and actually do it now
could be a monumental effort.
But it is worth it, it does pay dividends in the end
if in fact you ever get audited or in fact you have a breach
or some type of cyber incident occurs
and you don't have proper documentation on
how you were properly securing that data,
you could be opening yourself up to liability.
