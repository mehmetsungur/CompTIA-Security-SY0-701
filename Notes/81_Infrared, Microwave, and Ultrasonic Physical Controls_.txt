Okay, next, let's add a few things
to physical security.
We talked about that in the last module,
but a few things I wanna make sure that we're covering
that we didn't really touch on previously.
And that is infrared pressure sensors.
So these things use infrared light to detect motion,
which can in turn trigger an alarm, turn on lights,
send alerts, and so forth.
And we have two different types.
We have active and passive types, which are commonly used.
And then we have microwave.
Microwave sensors are more sensitive
than IR sensors or infrared.
And they can sense motion through non-metal materials,
like wood, plastic, and drywall,
commonly used in outdoor applications.
And then we also have ultrasonic, which detects objects
and distance to an object by emitting sound waves,
which are too high for humans to hear
but those sound waves will bounce back off of that object
and reflect back to the emitter.
And it can be made up of either two different devices,
one that emits and one that detects.
Or it could have one device that does both,
but it knows how fast that should come back.
And by understanding that, it can tell
how far an object is away,
or if an object moves into its path and so forth.
Incidentally, some types of ultrasonic sensors
can also be used underwater
to detect distance or actually how deep something is
and so forth.
