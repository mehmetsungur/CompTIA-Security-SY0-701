Okay, so general data considerations.
So types of data to secure.
So we've talked about these before,
but just to refresh your memory.
We have data at-rest.
So this is data sitting on a hard drive or removable media,
and it's local to the computer,
or remotely on a storage area network or a SAN,
or network-attached storage.
And when we're talking about data at-rest,
encryption is obviously the way to protect that data.
And then data in-transit,
that's data being sent over a wired
or a wireless network.
And then a VPN connection would be in order here
that would encrypt the data while it's in-transit,
again, wired or wireless.
And then we have data in-use.
So it's not data at-rest,
it's actually being used or in RAM in that computer.
It's usually only on one particular node on a network.
It could be memory resident,
it could be sitting in a swap or temp space, and so forth.
