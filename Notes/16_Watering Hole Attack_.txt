And the next, a watering hole attack,
just to add a little bit more detail
to what we talked about previously.
So in a nutshell, it's a sophisticated attack
that identifies less secure websites
that target users are likely to visit.
And by attacking those websites,
the attacker can plant malware on those sites.
From there, malicious code can scan the user's computer
for vulnerabilities, for zero-days, et cetera, et cetera
and it may download additional information to that computer
to initiate additional attacks, to siphon data,
to render it useless whether it's ransomware or so forth
or whatever else the attacker may have in mind.
