So another term I want you to be familiar with
is the concept of a Bug bounty.
So a Bug bounty is a program that is used to encourage users
to find and report bugs.
So if your current company does not have a Bug bounty,
then I would recommend that you look at implementing one
if at all possible.
It promotes goodwill and it invites people
to actually pen test your system,
or at least look for vulnerabilities.
And if and when they find them,
then it then incense them to then provide that information
to you so you can remediate.
And this can be an internal or an external program.
And awards could range from a simple recognition
to compensation.
And in some Bug bounty programs, that recognition
or compensation rather could go upwards of 30, 40, $50,000,
so it's not an insignificant sum.
So just for your own information,
the first Bug bounty was actually implemented in 1983,
and then years later, the phrase was actually coined
by an Netscape engineer in 1995.
So Bug bounty programs can range in complexity,
they can range in how they're actually reported.
You can simply have a form on your website
where people can submit bugs,
or you can have a more formalized bug tracking program
that can be done either internally or externally,
or you could actually partner with an external company
that would run the Bug bounty program for you.
Hacker One is an example, and according to their website,
they're actually affiliated with a network
of over 750,000 ethical hackers that they work with.
And then they would develop a Bug bounty program for you
and have them test your site, test your applications,
and so forth, turning in the vulnerabilities that they find
and making your system applications and so forth
that much more secure.
