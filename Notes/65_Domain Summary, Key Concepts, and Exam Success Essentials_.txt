All right, you've reached
the end of this course, congrats.
Let's take a quick look at the Domain Summary
for Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations.
So we talked a lot throughout this course,
and we will through others, about Bob and Alice.
Well, here's Alice to actually tell us a little bit more
about this specific one.
So CompTIA Security, SY0-701,
so that's where we're at.
Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
for CompTIA Security+.
It's the 2nd course of five domains.
So again, as I mentioned, congrats,
we're almost halfway there.
The first one was, General Security Concepts.
Obviously this is, Threats, Vulnerabilities,
and Mitigations.
Next, is Security Architecture,
and we'll move on from there.
Okay, so I do have one little secret to share.
This is not really Alice,
let's just keep that
