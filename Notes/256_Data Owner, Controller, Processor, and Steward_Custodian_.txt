Next, we have a few additional roles
to talk about, one is owner.
So data is typically not owned
by an individual, so data is actually owned
by the enterprise or the company.
So therefore, owners are really assigned
for management compliance and accountabilities.
Owners can assign permissions
and also set access controls for that data or resource.
We also have things like data controllers and processors.
So processing is any operation, whether automated
or manual that's performed on personal data.
A data processor is responsible for processing of
that personal data on behalf of the data controller,
and then the data controller themselves is the person
that determines the purpose
and the means by which personal data is processed.
So all of these roles work together
to make sure personal data is processed appropriately
and within compliance standards.
Next, we have a steward or a custodian.
So a data steward or a data custodian is responsible
for maintaining data quality.
So this incorporates processes, policies,
and guidelines that defines the various terms,
the metadata around data, basically the description
of the data itself that they will steward.
And what we're ultimately trying to do here is ensuring
that data is relevant and quote unquote fit for use.
So that way it's defined
and we can also show that the data that we're compiling
and keeping is actually necessary
for the activities we're engaged in
in our daily business processes.
Already that brings us to the end of this module.
A lot of very pertinent information there
around the elements of security governance, guidelines,
policies, standards, and the different types of roles
and responsibilities for systems and data.
So hopefully you learned a bit
and found that informative.
Stick around because up next
we'll be talking about the risk management process.
See you in the next module.
