And then something else to consider is
we have bandwidth selection and also the width.
So two main frequency bands.
We have 2.4 gigahertz and then five gigahertz.
Now, I won't read through all of these,
but you can pause for a second and read through these.
But just understand that 2.4 gigahertz is
obviously a slower speed than five gigahertz,
but it will typically travel farther
and is a little more ubiquitous
among IOT devices and so forth.
Now, when it comes to channel frequencies, as an example,
not something you necessarily need to know for the exam,
but I just wanna put it out there for your information.
As an example,
here is a 2.4 gigahertz channel frequency, right?
We have channels one through 14,
and you can see there are some channels
that overlap with each other.
So you can see, you can adjust
or jump from channel to channel
if you're in a specifically crowded area.
And you'll understand this
with Wi-Fi analyzers or site surveys.
And there's software you can download to your phone
and you can run it and it will show
all the different Wi-Fi hotspots in your area,
what's broadcasting and so forth.
And then also what channels they're broadcasting on.
So you can adjust yours so that you're not overlapping,
'cause if the channels get too crowded,
then your speeds may suffer,
you may have connectivity issues, and so forth.
So as you can see, there are some things you can tweak
to make sure that you're getting optimal speed,
optimal power considerations,
and then also using channels
that aren't heavily utilized wherever possible.
