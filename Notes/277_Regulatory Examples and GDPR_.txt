Some regulatory examples,
I won't go through all of these,
but a couple big ones are GDPR
or the General Data Protection Regulation,
the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA,
and then HIPAA.
They're the big three that most people need to focus on.
There are a few others here that I will list
that I recommend you take a look at on your own.
But for our discussion here, we'll focus on GDPR.
So the General Data Protection Regulation,
it was a privacy and security law
that originated in the European Union in May of 2018.
So it's been around for a while now.
So it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere,
that mean globally, so long as they target
or collect data related to people in the EU.
So what type of data does it cover?
So it provides individuals,
otherwise known as data subjects,
more control over how organizations process
or control the processing of their data.
Things like names, locations,
patient data and health records,
email addresses, and of course, photos.
So essentially any data that could be used
to identify a living person.
As we talked about, GDPR fines and penalties
can be pretty significant.
So fines, GDPR allows for fines of up to €20 million
or 4% of a company's global annual revenue,
whichever is higher.
A lot of times, when we're talking about fines
or regulations or restrictions,
it's like two different things
and whatever is the lesser of the two.
Well, in this case, it's the exact opposite,
whichever is greater.
So if you're a relatively small company,
you could be fined up to €20 million.
If you're a major trillion dollar company,
you could have 4% of that company's global annual revenue
as a potential fine.
So extremely significant,
something you definitely need to pay attention to.
