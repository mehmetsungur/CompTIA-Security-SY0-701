So one concept I wanna make sure
you're aware of is attestation,
and we've mentioned that before,
but just to reiterate, it's a formal statement
or a certification to confirm the accuracy,
the truthfulness, or the authenticity of a particular fact,
a particular statement, a document, or a process.
So it provides verification of compliance
with relevant laws, regulations, perhaps industry standards,
and also internal policies.
So that's really crucial in demonstrating to stakeholders,
internal customers, partners, regulators,
and so forth, that the organization takes security
and compliance seriously.
Also, trust and transparency.
So we wanna build that trust with customers and clients,
and also business partners,
so it demonstrates a commitment to security and compliance,
and again, reassure stakeholders that their data
and interests are protected.
Also, legal and regulatory requirements.
So depending upon the location and also the industry,
attestation could be a legal requirement,
so organizations there must provide evidence of compliance
through audit reports, through assessments,
and also certifications
to meet certain regulatory obligations.
As we know, non-compliance with these types of requirements
can result in legal consequences, fines,
and also reputational damage.
And then we also have internal accountability.
Attestation processes also hold internal teams
and employees basically accountable
for security and compliance.
So again, bottom line, we wanna make sure
everyone's on the same page and that we're demonstrating
to the proper authorities, to partners, customers,
and so forth that we take this security business seriously.
