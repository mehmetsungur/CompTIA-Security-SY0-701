Okay, next let's talk about spyware.
And spyware is malicious software
that captures user activity and then reports back.
So we're talking about keystrokes,
web browsing activity, so on and so forth.
So as an example,
here, we have a user who's sitting down through PC
to do some coding.
And of course, everybody knows the best way to code
is to have the projector projecting directly into your eyes
and on your face while you're doing your coding.
But seriously, anything that's entered in,
if in fact, there's spyware on that machine,
well, then there's a bad actor on the other side of that
who potentially has the ability
to either monitor that in real time
or periodically those keystrokes are saved to a file
and then emailed out or exfiltrated via some other method.
Or if that bad actor is physical access to the network,
they can retrieve that information at any time.
So as an example, here's a basic network.
We have a few PCs, we have a server, a router,
and then a malicious web server
that sits outside of our network.
Well, if there happens to be spyware
installed on that server, Server A, for instance,
well then anything that's entered onto that server, right,
the spyware is gonna capture keystrokes.
It will then be periodically emailed out
or sent out real time to that malicious web server.
And as I mentioned, the bad actor then has the ability
to monitor that either real time
or periodically as it gets emailed out
or whenever they wish.
