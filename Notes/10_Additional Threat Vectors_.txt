Some additional threat vectors.
We have removable devices, like USB devices,
thumb drives, and so forth.
We've talked about that before.
Group policy and administrative policies should limit
or restrict their use.
Again, this is a very common attack vector.
Throw a few USB drives around a building or a parking lot,
people are likely to pick them up and say,
"Hm, wonder what's on here," plug it into their laptop
or their PC.
And then if that USB device happens to have malware
or ransomware on there, it's an easy in to that network.
And then we have vulnerable software,
client-based, which is something that's installed,
or agentless, it can be using existing protocols,
communication, or authentication mechanisms.
And if the software itself is not patched
or if it's agently and using existing protocols
or communication mechanisms that are not up to speed
and patched, those things, again, can be inroads
into that network or into that computer.
Unsupported systems and applications,
very similarly, software that's not supported
is typically then not monitored.
We all know what that means.
Vulnerabilities start to pop up
because it's not being patched regularly.
So again, something to watch out for.
Some of this stuff can be mitigated via policies,
whether it's administrative or technical.
But again, it has to be put company-wide.
Training is a big part of that.
And then unsecure networks.
Wired or wireless networks,
along with Bluetooth communication,
should be locked down with proper authentication mechanisms
or disabled if not needed.
