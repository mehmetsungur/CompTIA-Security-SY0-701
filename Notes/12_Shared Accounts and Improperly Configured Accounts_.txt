Something else that's a big no-no
more often than not is shared accounts.
Users should not be able to share accounts
or use group accounts, right?
That reduces auditing and logging.
It's very hard or almost impossible to tell
what users made a change, accessed or deleted a file,
and so forth, right?
So here we have a group account on a specific server.
Well, we have Emily, we have Mike, we have CJ,
and we have Jack all using the same group account.
So what that does is it kind of negates non-repudiation.
So being able to identify and validate user activity
more or less goes out the window.
So at that point, say something happens on that server,
something was accessed or deleted or something was changed,
and we say, "Okay, well who did that, Emily?"
"Nope, I didn't do it."
"Mike?"
