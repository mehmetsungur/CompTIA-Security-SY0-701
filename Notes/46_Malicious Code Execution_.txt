When we're talking
about malicious code execution,
understand that there are a number
of ways that this can happen.
Recently, over 50% of malware attacks
are utilizing PowerShell.
We also have Python.
It could be Bash scripting,
it could be macros built into Excel spreadsheets,
and so forth.
It could also be VBA or Visual Basic for Applications.
So all of these things are prime spots
for malicious code to exist
and then be launched on target machines.
And then the methods that we actually get
that malicious code to the victim,
it could be sent via email or malicious links
so it can be installed and run to execute,
like I said, man in the middle or man in the browser,
or other data manipulation or exfiltration attacks.
It could be via infected USB sticks
and other removable media.
So scripts can be executed automatically upon access,
as I mentioned, to install malicious code.
It could be malware, ransomware, Trojans, or backdoors.
And then, as I just said,
the actual remote access Trojan or the RAT or the backdoor
can allow complete control over a target system,
including access to browser sessions,
to data, turn on webcams,
it can turn on microphones, it can screenshot,
capture all that stuff, store it locally,
and then periodically email it
or send it out to a command and control server,
or it can allow an attacker real-time access to that system,
to all the files on that system,
to access the webcam and just watch it in real-time,
along with audio and anything else
that that computer connects to.
