Okay, up next is a virus.
And a virus is malicious code
that requires user interaction.
So it requires the user to actually do something
to install and to replicate.
So in this example, we have a computer
that interacts with another computer.
That computer downloads something to that computer
or sends it somehow, whether it's a malicious link,
the user inadvertently clicks on an email attachment
or what have you.
So the computer listed in pink is the infected computer,
and once it's installed on that computer,
then it's the old saying, you know, one friend told two,
who told two, who told two.
And then as it goes through the network,
of course it has an opportunity to spread pretty rapidly,
but it requires user interaction to actually install.
And it usually has a goal to try
to either steal information, encrypt something,
perhaps take a system offline
or some other type of malicious activity.
Viruses, for the most part, try to be stealthy
so they install without detection
or as little as possible
so they can do whatever they need to do.
Perhaps download additional pieces of software,
additional pieces of malware, like I said, encrypt data,
steal data, so on and so forth.
