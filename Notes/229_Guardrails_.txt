Guardrails is another.
So that's basically predefined policies and rules
that help ensure compliance, security,
and resource utilization.
So automation scripts can enforce guardrails, of course,
by checking against established policies
and adjusting or raising alerts or violations.
Just like we have guardrails in the road here
keeps us from going off the edge out into the ocean,
the same thing happens from a technical perspective as well.
We have guardrails set up so that we don't over-utilize
so we don't spin up additional resources we don't need,
so we don't have rogue processes,
database queries and so forth
that just run and run and run and spend up resources.
We can put guardrails in place against processes,
quotas against consumption and so forth
to ensure that we're maximizing resources
and not incurring unnecessary costs.
So popular tools for that one
would be AWS Config and Chef InSpec.
