Next, let's talk about AAA,
or authentication, authorization, and accounting.
So, authentication identifies the user
and allows or denies access
or challenges for additional credentials,
such as a pin or a rotating code.
Authorization provides things like length of time allowed
on the network or ACLs, access control lists,
for various resources and so forth,
basically, a list of saying who can access what,
what level of permissions they have,
whether it's read, write, execute, and so forth.
And then we have accounting.
So that tracks the start and stop time of each session
and can be used for things like billing or for showback,
or (laughs) in some case, shame back, right?
We're trying to tell users or departments
how much time they're using,
how much resources they're consuming.
Sometimes they don't have a formalized chargeback method
where we can actually charge them for those resources,
but we can at least give them a showback
or show them what they're using,
or in some cases, shame back.
We put them on a naughty list
and send that to executive management and say,
"Hey, this department over here
"is consuming all these resources,
"and they're not paying for it.
"So perhaps we can get them to start boning up
"and giving us some money
"for all the things that they're consuming."
