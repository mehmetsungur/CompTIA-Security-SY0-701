When it comes to vendor monitoring,
some things to keep in mind.
We have risk assessment,
so when selecting vendors, assessment
of their security practices,
and of course, prior performance is crucial.
I've talked about this just a moment ago.
So this includes data breaches, supply chain attacks,
and any compliance issues.
So you're well within your right to ask these things,
and you should be doing that as part of due diligence.
Vendor selection in general, right?
Proper selection includes vendors
who have a strong security posture
that aligns with your own.
So application of best practices,
comprehensive incident response plans, et cetera.
Again, part of the due diligence process
to make sure their protocols, their processes,
and their best practices are in alignment with your own.
And then ongoing monitoring.
So it's important to continually verify
and validate a vendor's security posture
and overall alignment, right?
This is not a one-time assessment.
This should be done on a continual basis,
hence, the right to audit we talked about previously,
also penetration testing,
possibly if they're in agreement to that,
but regardless, one way or the other,
you should be making sure
that you are monitoring
that relationship on an ongoing basis.
