Next, let's talk about intrusion detection
systems and intrusion prevention systems.
Again, things we've talked about before,
but I just wanna put in the context of this video.
So we're looking for things like trends,
and we can tune and make sure we configure properly
to identify trends.
So as we know, the threat landscape is constantly evolving,
which requires continuous updating
of IDS and IPS systems as well.
So it benefits us and makes our data more accurate
if we incorporate the latest intelligence and threat data.
So to that end, we can integrate with other systems
like SIM and EDR systems, right?
So integration with these tool sets and these platforms
allows for a layered defense, or defense in depth,
and allows us to build a cohesive security ecosystem
with each system helping to enrich the data.
The more the data is enriched,
the more accurate it becomes, the better off we are.
And then also, signatures.
We often use signatures to identify threats
if they match a certain set of criteria.
So as you can imagine, they need to be constantly updated,
along with heuristics
and also behavior-based methods as well,
to help identify new threats and also zero day attacks.
