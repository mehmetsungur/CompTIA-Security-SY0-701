So really when we're talking about
disaster recovery and keeping things going,
we're talking about continuity of operations.
We need to keep the lights on,
we need to keep people working.
We need to keep business flowing.
So there are a few types of plans
that help us accomplish this goal.
So plans will typically fall into four categories.
We have incident management, we have business continuity,
disaster recovery, and then business resumption.
So these plans could be separate and distinct documents,
or they could be one larger document.
Again, each business and each organization
will treat this slightly differently,
but these things should be accounted for.
So let's take each of these one by one.
So disaster recovery plans,
similar in scope to a business continuity plan,
but focused on information technology.
So tasks, action lists, order of recovery,
emergency contact information for key personnel
and interested parties, documentation,
references to incident management
or command center location.
So all of these things should be documented
way ahead of time.
It's not the time to actually try to do this
when you're in the middle of a crisis.
So it's crucially important to have this information
documented, vetted, and kept up to date.
So if and when disaster strikes, you know what to do.
And then the various activities associated with people,
process, and technology.
