Hey everybody, welcome back to Pluralsight.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees,
and in this module we'll be talking about
effective security compliance.
Let's go ahead and take a look at what we'll cover
in this module.
A few high level topics.
We have Compliance Reporting.
We have the Consequences of Non-Compliance,
which is a big one.
Also, Compliance Monitoring, and Privacy.
And as usual, let's take a look behind the curtain
and see what the subtopics are.
I'll go ahead and pause so you can take a look if you like.
And then when you're ready, let's go ahead and get started.
As you might have guessed, we're gonna talk about
why is this important?
And basically, security compliance is a key element
to safeguarding an organization's assets.
This includes physical threats, cyber attacks,
as well as protection from legal consequences,
which can be quite severe,
we'll talk about in just a moment.
Fines, and also damage to an organization's reputation.
Some of the benefits of effective security compliance
are legal and regulatory requirements.
We're basically making sure we comply with those.
Protection against cyber threats goes without saying.
Also risk management, customer trust and reputation,
internal governance, incident response preparedness,
competitive advantage,
and of course, continuous improvement.
All of these you've talked about before,
but these are key byproducts,
or downstream effects of having an effective
security compliance program.
