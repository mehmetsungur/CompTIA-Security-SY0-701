Next, we have the concept of key exchange.
And we have both in-band and also out-of-band.
So an out-of-band key exchange, not sent over the network.
So that needs to be delivered via traditional
or manual means, whether that's in person, telephone,
courier, et cetera.
Whereas we have in-band key exchange,
and that can be done over the network
as the communication session is established.
So that can be created in real time
and then typically discarded once the session is over.
