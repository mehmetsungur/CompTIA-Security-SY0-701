Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to the Pluralsight.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees,
and in this video we're talking about the indicators
of malicious activity.
So let's take a look at what we're gonna be covering
here in this module.
We're gonna be talking about the various types of attacks,
so malware, physical attacks, network attacks,
application attacks, cryptographic,
and also password attacks. And then we'll also dig in
to the various indicators of compromise.
And as always, let's take a look a little bit deeper
and see what we're gonna cover by a lot of subtopics here.
So you'll notice I have two that are in pink,
and they're actually topics that I covered
in another module, so I keep them here
just because they're on the objectives list,
but just understand they were covered elsewhere.
So as you can see, it's a jam-packed module,
a lot of stuff to cover here.
So I'll go ahead and pause for just a second
if you want to go ahead and read through this,
and then when you're ready, let's go ahead and get started.
Okay, let's start off and talk about an indicator
of compromise, or an IOC.
So an indicator of compromise is an artifact
that's observed with a high degree of confidence
that indicates a computer intrusion.
So some potential indicators of compromise
might be unusual, outbound network traffic,
DNS request anomalies,
it could be mismatched port to application traffic,
or it could be anomalies
in privileged user account activity.
So again, all of these things may or may not appear
as an indicator of compromise
if you don't have baselines set.
So if you don't know what's normal in your environment,
then it's gonna be pretty hard
to understand what's abnormal.
So when we talk about the concept of setting baselines
and understanding what, in fact, is normal
in your environment, it's critical
because otherwise, how do you tell what's abnormal?
All right, so keep those things in mind
as we go through the rest of this module.
So first off, let's talk about the various types
of malware attacks.
So first and foremost,
we have crypto malware, or ransomware.
So this is malicious applications that scare
or scam users into taking some type of action,
so this typically revolves around paying the creator
for the removal of that ransomware
or the decryption of those files.
And it could range from thousands of dollars up to millions
or multi-millions of dollars, depending upon the breach
and the scale or the scope of the attack.
And I say take that with a grain of salt
because sometimes people have paid a ransom
and the decryption doesn't actually work,
or someone has paid a ransom to decrypt those files
and then the company doesn't do anything
to actually close the hole that the attackers came through,
and then several weeks later, guess what?
They were actually attacked again
and had to pay a second ransom.
So it's important, obviously, to get your information back
and get your company back online and up and running,
but it's also equally important to understand
how that breach occurred and to make sure you mitigate
or close the holes that they came in through.
So an example of crypto malware or ransomware,
the WannaCry attack, or Wcrypt,
was one of the more famous ones,
and that quickly spread to over 150 countries
and infected over 200,000 computers within just a few days.
So a pretty insane amount of coverage very, very quickly.
So it spread via Microsoft's EternalBlue vulnerability,
and that was subsequently patched with MS 17-010,
which describes the actual patch
that was implemented by Microsoft.
And then of course, administrators around the world
spent the next couple days or a couple weeks
patching all their systems,
which is always such a fun time.
But just to understand, malware is not going anywhere
and certainly not decreasing.
So so far this year, 2023,
we've seen a 49% increase in ransomware attacks
over the same period in 2022,
and that comes from blackfrog.com,
which is a security website that tracks these things.
But just understand that ransomware is not slowing down.
It's only getting worse.
