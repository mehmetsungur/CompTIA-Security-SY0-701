And then when it comes
to everybody's favorite, right?
Standard operating procedures, no one likes tons
and tons of books and documentation and rules
and so forth, rules and regulations.
But the reality is those things make for a successful,
smooth-running operation.
So it really is a set of procedures
or directions on how things are done,
and it covers everything.
Even back when I was in law enforcement,
we were very, very rigid
as far as standard operating procedures.
Everything had a specific way that it needed to be done,
and if you deviated from that, there were consequences.
So by having everything very, very standardized,
everyone knew exactly how they were supposed to operate,
what was acceptable and what was not acceptable.
And it made things very, very easy.
So in this context, it's details of how tasks
are to be accomplished, and then also what things
are to be upgraded or patched in a specific,
maybe maintenance ticket or maintenance window,
how issues are handled, how are they rolled back,
and so on and so forth.
And then also the approval and the escalation procedures.
So again, if we put in a ticket, it goes
to perhaps a peer review first,
and then to a manager to approve.
It may have to go to a higher level, depending upon the time
of day, time of year, do we have special events going on?
All of that good stuff.
And then if things go wrong, who do we escalate to?
Our internal folks, management,
but then also perhaps vendors that we have to deal with.
Do we open a ticket with them ahead of time proactively
so they're already aware and on standby?
Or do we just wait until something goes bump
and then we reach out and say,
"Hey, we need some help with something."
So again, all of those things should be identified
and called out in a standard operating procedure
or a manual so that everyone, no matter who they are,
knows the proper way to operate and how everybody else
or every other group is also operating.
And then lastly, the services, the platforms,
and the environments impacted by that procedure.
So again, we're always having our fingers crossed.
We're optimistic, folks by nature, you know,
most of us anyway.
