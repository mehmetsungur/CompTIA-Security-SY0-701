Another way for mobile devices to connect,
obviously, is via Wi-Fi.
So a few things there.
Disabling our SSID, or our Security Set Identifier.
Now, this won't actually keep a more skilled hacker
from actually finding the network,
but it will prevent clients
who are just browsing from discovering the network.
So it is one of a number of things
that should be done to help secure Wi-Fi,
but this in and of itself
won't do much against a skilled hacker,
but just one tool in the tool shed.
And then also MAC Filtering
predefines which Media Access Control, or MAC addresses,
can connect to the router or to an access point.
Again, this won't prevent a skilled hacker
from spoofing a MAC address,
but it will keep a vast majority
of the lesser skilled bad actors off the network.
And then it also requires Secure Connectivity Protocols.
So require WPA2, Pre-Shared Key, or PSK,
which uses AES, and that uses a Pre-Shared Key
with Advanced Encryption Standard at a minimum,
or, use WPA3.
WPA3 is not as widely adopted yet,
but it is a more secure option
and should be used whenever possible.
So a few additional areas of concern
when we're talking about
mobile devices, Wi-Fi and so forth,
common attack vectors, like intercepting data,
man-in-the-middle attacks, or on-path attacks,
and then also data corruption.
When we're talking about Bluetooth,
we have to be concerned with bluejacking and bluesnarfing.
Then there's satellite communications.
There's ANT+, which is health and gym equipment.
And then infrared.
These last three are very specific
and not as big of a threat,
but again, something that should be considered.
So disable unnecessary services,
ensure devices are patched, updated,
and encrypt communication wherever possible.
So you see a bit of a recurring theme here.
It's basically keeping our devices
patched, updated and encrypted will go 90% of the way
towards getting us to a secure environment.
