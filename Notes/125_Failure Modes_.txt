Next, let's talk about failure modes
and these different systems we just mentioned.
Sometimes they fail.
Like anything,
whether it's an application, a piece of hardware,
a piece of software, occasionally devices will fail.
First, we have fail-open,
and this is really centering around the fact that
when equipment fails or a breach occurs,
the equipment fails open.
In other words, it allows access to continue.
So it prioritizes availability
or accessibility of the resource itself over security.
In other words, if something fails, we wanna know about it,
we wanna fix it as quick as possible,
but we don't want to shut the thing down.
We don't wanna close the gate
and then cut off connectivity,
cut off maybe users coming in,
buying things, you know, what have you.
We don't wanna cut the revenue stream off, in other words.
So that doesn't mean we don't get alerted.
It doesn't mean we don't go after it
and fix the problem as quick as possible.
It just means we're not gonna shut things down.
And then we have fail-closed.
So in this scenario,
equipment failure or security breach will
cause the system to block access or traffic
to protect the system or the resource.
So it prioritizes security over accessibility.
So just two different ways of attacking the problem.
Again, both will cause alerts,
both will send out the troops, if you will,
and we'll try to fix that as quickly as possible.
One allows traffic to continue
and access to continue while we're fixing it.
The other shuts things down,
basically pulls up the drawbridge and no access.
