Okay, so when we're trying to secure
the enterprise.
We have a few things to keep in mind regarding connectivity.
We have a few options, in other words.
So we have virtual private networks or VPNs,
so that provides secure connectivity
over an insecure medium.
In other words, the internet.
We'll talk more about VPNs in just a moment.
We also have segmentation or isolation,
and we've talked about that in a previous video as well.
But in this context,
our hosts must authenticate and meet minimum criteria
before being allowed on the network.
And then of course, firewalls.
So firewalls in this context, web application firewall,
or a next-generation firewall.
And we'll talk about firewalls in more detail
in just a few as well.
But for now, just keep in mind that these are our few ways
that we can make sure that connectivity
to our network is secured.
