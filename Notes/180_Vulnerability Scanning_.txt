Okay, so first up, let's talk
about identification methods.
So the first thing we wanna cover is vulnerability scanning.
And the distinction I wanna make here
is vulnerability scanning is different
from penetration testing.
You may or may not be familiar with one
or either of those terms,
however, they should be performed in tandem
when doing penetration testing.
So pen testing will include vulnerability scanning,
but we can do vulnerability scanning
without doing pen testing.
And vulnerability scanning is non intrusive,
and it can be performed with credentials
or without credentials, depending upon the risk tolerance.
So it really boils down to what do we wanna achieve,
how invasive do we wanna be?
That may mean interacting with various teams
to get different sets of credentials
for different applications, different ports, protocols
and systems and so forth, or we may choose
to do a less intrusive scan without credentials.
But no matter which way we choose,
we wanna make sure we always obtain consent prior
to beginning any type of vulnerability scan or pen testing.
So if you're working in IT security or your own company,
then chances are you're already gonna be aware
or someone in your group will already be aware.
But don't assume everyone throughout the company
or other groups may not see that pen testing
or that vulnerability scan and start to raise alarms.
Or if you're a consultant or a third party
and it's not your company and you don't
necessarily have full buy-in from everyone
within the company or everyone you may be interacting with,
vulnerability scanning and pen testing can
in fact raise alarms and can then spin up resources
and get people all fired up, only to find out
that you're doing testing that you didn't tell anyone about
or weren't necessarily authorized to do.
So that's what we call an RGE, a resume generating event.
So we don't wanna do that.
So plain and simple, just make sure you're operating
with the proper permissions and document the process
and keep those authorization forms readily available.
