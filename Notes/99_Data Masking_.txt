Next is the concept of data masking.
So data masking can be a couple different things.
It can be done within applications
or databases at the individual record, row, column
or an entire table.
We also have IP address masking.
So that can be things like network address translation
or NAT, and that enables private IP addresses to be masked
behind a proxy or a firewall.
And data masking can also be static or dynamic.
So data at rest or data in transit,
and can be done with a variety of methods,
whether it's encryption, substitution, nulling,
tokenization, as we just talked about, et cetera.
So a quick example, right?
If we do an unmasked query result, we query a database,
good old Alice and Bob, we're querying
for specific data about those guys.
Well, an unmasked query result will return back
to the person or the system actually requesting that data.
It'll give them the full information.
Well, if we implement data masking,
well, then that masked query result would only come back
and say, Yep, we have Alice and Bob in our system."
And their SSNs are basically Xed out,
or might give us like the last four
of their Social Security number or something, right?
The masking can be done to different levels,
but it's basically obfuscating data to a certain degree
so that it's not returned back in full to the person
or the system querying that result.
