So let's talk about
the concept of multipathing.
So in very simple terms,
it's a redundancy concept that provides multiple paths,
hence the name, from point A to point B.
So this can apply to networking, compute,
storage, or applications.
And in this example, we have a server.
It's got two HBAs, HBA1 and HBA2.
Now an HBA is a host bus adapter.
It's much like a NIC,
but for fiber channel and SAN connectivity.
So like a normal network interface cord,
you would have to connect it to an ethernet network.
In fiber channel you have HBAs.
So in this example, two SAN fabrics,
SAN fabric A, SAN fabric B,
and they're basically a network.
In the fiber channel world,
we have two distinct fabrics, fabric A and B.
They don't touch each other, but it gives us redundancy
and two separate networks to connect to storage.
So again, in this example we have two storage arrays,
array controller one and two,
and there's some disks on the back end.
So the server will connect to both switches
and then those switches will connect
to both controllers on the SAN storage array.
So as you can see, there are multiple paths
from the server to storage.
So it may take one path where it goes over SAN fabric A
and over to array control one,
or the next time around it might go out HBA2
onto SAN fabric B, and then also over to array control one.
So what this does is gives us redundancy
across a number of different areas, HBAs, the SAN switches,
the fabrics themselves, the array controllers.
There's redundancy at the component layer from the server
all the way down to the disks on the storage array.
So it makes these types of setups highly available.
