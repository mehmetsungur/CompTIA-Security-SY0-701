Next is the concept of least privilege,
we've talked about that before.
And unfortunately, he's still mad
about having his permissions taken away.
So he's not happy about having a minimum level permissions.
But the reality is that's the best way to approach
because the practice of providing individuals or systems
with the minimum level of access or permissions necessary
to perform their job ensures security.
We don't want folks running around
with too many permissions.
We don't want to give people admin access
when all they need is read or write and so forth.
So it's very granular.
We should start out with a default deny
and then add in permissions as they need them.
And again, this lends itself to role-based access control
so that way when someone leaves one position
and joins another,
the permissions are transferred appropriately.
That's probably what happened to Skippy here.
He was in a group where he had lots of permissions,
maybe admin rights, and he got moved into a different role
where he only had read access
and apparently he doesn't like it,
so not much I can do for him unfortunately.
