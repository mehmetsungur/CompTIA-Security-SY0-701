So when I say monitoring computing resources,
what am I really talking about?
First off, I'm talking about systems of various types.
It could be physical, it could be virtual.
We're also talking about desktops, laptops, mobile devices,
again, servers, physical, virtual containers, and so forth.
Also, talking about applications, critical systems,
revenue generating systems, things that are public facing,
and of course, monitoring and reporting applications.
And then lastly, infrastructure.
So routers, switches, SAN or storage area networks,
and NAS arrays or network attached storage,
firewalls, load balancers, and things along those lines.
Pretty much everything in our environment
should be monitored to some degree.
Now, not everything is equally as important,
but they should be monitored
because pretty much everything in our environment
is an attack surface,
especially if it's not configured properly.
So assuming that something's insignificant
or it doesn't matter, maybe a thermostat on the wall,
some motion detecting device,
if it's connected to the network,
especially if it's Wi-Fi enabled,
well, it very well could be an attack vector,
and those things should be monitored appropriately.
