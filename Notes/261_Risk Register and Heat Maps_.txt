So next we have a risk register.
So you may also see this referred to as, again,
a risk register or a risk assessment matrix,
or a risk heat map.
And what it allows us to do is prioritize things
based upon the likelihood rating and also the consequences.
So we basically stack rank things from rare,
almost never happening, to almost certain,
and then the consequences from insignificant
up to catastrophic.
So it allows us to stack rank risks.
So it allows us to understand more concretely
where we need to focus and where we need to put resources,
again, funding people, process, technology, what have you,
where we need to direct those resources
to mitigate those risks.
So if something is almost certain to happen,
but the consequences is insignificant,
then that would be medium on our scale.
If something is likely to happen but insignificant,
it would be low.
So in other words, let's say, for instance,
something is unlikely to happen,
but if it did happen, it would be catastrophic.
That would rate high on our matrix,
meaning we should really pay attention to this
and see what can we do to mitigate that risk.
By the same token, if we have something that's likely
to happen, but it's minor if it actually did happen,
the consequences would be minor
or the net would rate as a medium.
So it allows us to basically put a qualitative assessment
on specific risks, and, as I mentioned,
stack rank and then direct resources appropriately.
