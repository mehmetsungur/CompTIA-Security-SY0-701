And then lastly, we have something called
typo squatting or URL hijacking,
and this revolves around setting up domain names
to basically capitalize on the fact
that users make typos, right?
And so instead of typing Facebook, they type Factbook;
instead of Google, they may type in Goggle or Googel
or Google with two Gs, et cetera, et cetera.
So hackers will register these domain names
in every iteration you can think of
around those domain names so that when users type
in something incorrectly, it takes them to a site.
It's used to capture user credentials,
or they might be ad portals that are just full of ads
that might appeal to a user going to that website.
So, again, it's a fraudulent website,
but it's along the same lines
as the one they were trying to visit,
and then they fill it full of ads,
hoping to create some ad revenue
by supplying complimentary advertising.
So it's not necessarily like completely malicious
in that they're trying to steal data, or take someone down,
or take a company offline necessarily,
it certainly could be, but a lot of times,
it's basically just to try to serve ads and make money
off the fact that someone went to
a fake website when they were trying to
actually go to something legitimate.
So I hope this module wasn't informative for you,
but please stick around because, up next,
we'll cover various types of vulnerabilities.
So I'll see you in the next module.
