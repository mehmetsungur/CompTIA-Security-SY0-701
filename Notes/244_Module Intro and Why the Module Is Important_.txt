Hey everybody, welcome back to Pluralsight.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees.
And in this module, we'll be talking about
using data sources to support an investigation.
Let's go ahead and take a look at
what we'll cover in this module.
We'll be talking about three main areas.
First off, log data and then data sources
and then scenarios.
So let's pull back the curtain just a bit.
You can see we have subtopics in each of these categories,
and we'll also go over a number of different scenarios,
some of the methods you might use
if you find yourself in that scenario,
along with some of the more popular tools
that you might use to help you in those scenarios.
So go ahead and pause here for a second if you need to,
and then when you're ready, let's go ahead and get started.
Okay, so in essence, why is this important?
Leveraging data to support an investigation is critical
to supporting a case, zeroing in on root cause,
and also to understanding not only why
but how an incident occurred.
So benefits of accurate and timely data collection
are things like evidence gathering,
threat detection, forensic analysis,
compliance and auditing, also vulnerability assessments,
incident response, user accountability, pattern analysis,
continuous monitoring, and also historical context.
So let's just click down one level
and dig into each of these just a moment
and explore really why they're important.
