Next, let's talk
about online versus offline backups.
So, in a traditional sense, we have a main data center,
but if you really wanna protect our critical assets
against things like cyber attacks, ransomware, and so forth,
we may implement what's called a cyber-bunker.
So a cyber-bunker is basically where we're replicating data,
and it may be some data
or it may be all of our data just depends upon, again,
your specific situation,
but we're implementing in such a way
that we're actually creating an air-gapped environment.
So that logical air-gap basically means the connection
between these two things,
between the main data center and the cyber-bunker,
is only active when the replication is taking place,
and then that link is taken down.
So that way if a hacker came into our network,
they're not gonna be able to jump over into the cyber-bunker
because that connection is down.
There's lots of ways to architect this.
You can have additional security,
additional sets of credentials, and so forth,
so only certain folks and certain teams
can access the cyber-bunker.
So again, you can ratchet it down
and make it as granular as you like,
but the concept that I wanna make sure you understand here
is the air-gap.
