So when it comes to compliance monitoring,
we need to make sure we take due diligence and care.
So continuous assessment to ensure the organization's
due care measures align with due diligence findings.
So to reiterate, basically meaning if we find something,
we're actually going to correct it.
So regular reviewing of security policies
and procedures is definitely something
that should be an ongoing process.
And then attestation and acknowledgement.
So tracking and verifying attestations
and acknowledgements means we ensure that individuals
and entities are held accountable
for their commitment to compliance.
So in other words, we put out these policies
and procedures, we want people to read them, act upon them,
basically internalize them, and then we actually need them
to say and confirm, "Yes, I read the policy.
"Yes, I'm adhering to those practices and principles."
And then also, as I mentioned,
internal and external monitoring.
So internal checks help to identify
and rectify issues proactively, while external assessments
ensure that the organization meets external requirements
and avoids those potential penalties and fines.
And then automation is a big piece of that puzzle.
So continuously monitoring compliance metrics,
generating alerts for potential issues or deviations,
and also providing real-time visibility
into that organization's compliance status.
Automation takes a lot of that manual process,
a lot of that toil off an individual's plate,
increases accuracy and overall timeliness.
