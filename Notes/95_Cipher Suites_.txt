A couple quick words about cipher suites,
so, strong versus weak ciphers,
and a cipher is an encryption algorithm.
So, computational resources and capabilities
continue to increase, right?
Every year we get faster computers,
all things being equal, the actual power
and the computational capabilities
will continue to increase year over year.
So strong ciphers can become weak,
or at least weaker, as computing power increases.
So in other words, what's state-of-The-art today,
six months, a year, five years from now,
might be deprecated, might be broken and no longer valid.
So current examples of some strong ciphers,
and you can look these up
to obviously get more details on these,
but ones you should be aware of are AES,
triple DES, or 3DES, and then also TwoFish.
So they're in use and considered to be a strong cipher.
Some weak ciphers or ones that are deprecated,
meaning no longer used,
are things like WEP and also WPA, right,
that are used for like mobile communications,
you'll see them on hotspots.
They used to be state of the art years ago
when we're trying to connect to a wireless access point,
but they have since been cracked, very quickly in fact,
and have been deprecated.
So, like I said, something that was great
a year, two years, five years ago, is no longer valid.
