So when we're talking about
the approval process, is it manual or is it automated?
So the approval chain itself, if we create a ticket,
does it automatically go to the person
that needs to approve it?
Do they automatically get notified?
All of that good stuff.
Within that ticket, whether it is manual or automated,
we should have details included in that ticket,
the notification process,
the global change review or change collisions.
What other changes are potentially going on that night
that may actually impact or collide with my change?
So understanding who's doing what
and making sure that we're not
stepping on each other's toes is critical, right?
(chuckling) Would be a very bad night
if you're in the middle of a massive storage upgrade
or massive server upgrade,
and the data center folks are actually doing a power upgrade
at the same time, and you're halfway through your patch
or halfway through your upgrade and the power gets cut.
Well, guess what?
(chuckling) That's not a good idea.
Not what you would call a good bonding experience.
So by following standard operating procedures
and making sure everyone else
is following those same procedures,
these types of things get greatly reduced.
