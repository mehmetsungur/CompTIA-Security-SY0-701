Next, let's talk about replication.
Replication is pretty straightforward.
Let's say for instance, we have a West Coast data center
and we also have an East coast data center.
So we have firewalls in front of each data center.
Those things are connected, so we can move data
from one data center to the other,
and what we're basically doing is replicating our storage
from one data center to the other.
That could be down to the file or volume level,
or we could do it an entire array at a time.
So it really just depends upon the organization's appetite
for risk, funding, resources, and so forth.
Another option will be to replicate to the cloud.
So you could do that either as a tertiary,
or a third copy of the data,
or perhaps you only have one data center,
whether it's West coast or East coast in this example,
and then you would just back up to the cloud.
So you wouldn't necessarily need to have two plus one.
