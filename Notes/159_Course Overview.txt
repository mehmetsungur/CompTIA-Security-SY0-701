Hey, everybody.
Welcome to Security Operations.
This course is the fourth course in our series
on CompTIA Security+ certification.
This certification prep course will help you prepare
for the SY0-701 exam.
In this course, we're going to cover the skills measured
in the security operations objective in the exam guide.
This objective is found in the exam objectives
or domains section of the exam guide,
which counts for 28% of the total exam.
My name is Christopher Rees,
and I'm an author, trainer, and enterprise senior IT leader.
I've been an instructor creating certification training
for over 20 years.
With over 50 courses created over the years,
I've had the privilege
of training over 600,000 students worldwide
who have collectively watched
over a million hours of content.
I hold over a dozen certifications
and have been CompTIA and Microsoft certified since 1999.
I also have 23 years of enterprise IT experience,
and I have over a decade of senior IT management experience
for a large enterprise organization.
Prior to that, I was a law enforcement officer
and detective specializing in computer crime investigations.

In the exercise files, you'll find a helpful study guide
