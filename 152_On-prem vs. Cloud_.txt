So when we talk about on-prem
versus the cloud, well, there's some things to keep in mind.
On-prem infrastructure, compute, storage network,
you own all of that.
So you have to maintain it,
you have to make sure your lifecycle it properly,
and so forth.
So you may have duplicate infrastructure,
it could be geo-disperse,
it could be four corner redundancy.
But if you wanna have a highly available environment,
you're gonna need multiples
of every piece of infrastructure.
So you may replicate, like I said, on-prem,
whether from one corner of your data center to another,
or you could replicate between data centers.
So also you need to maintain
backup and replication software.
You have to determine your level of resiliency,
your RPO and RTO, your recovery point objective,
and your recovery time objective.
We'll talk more about that in just a moment.
And then also identifying what data
needs to be backed up and replicated.
In a cloud environment,
infrastructure can be spun up on demand,
and it's handled by the cloud provider,
so you don't have to go out
and actually buy the infrastructure,
order it rack, stack, and figure all that good stuff.
Replication typically takes place between two or more sites,
and that's determined by the customer.
Administration, security, troubleshooting,
it's all handled by the provider.
And then backups and replication
can be provided as a service.
So again, you don't have to manage that specifically.
You just basically check a box,
tell it what you want backed up or replicated.
It takes place, but it's still up to you, the customer,
to determine the level of resiliency, the RPO and the RTO,
and then also what data needs to be backed up or replicated.
So some of the same tasks need to exist,
whether it's on-prem or in the cloud.
