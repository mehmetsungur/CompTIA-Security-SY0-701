Okay, next up, we have network attacks.
First on the list we have Distributed Denial of Service
attacks or DDOS.
So a DDOS attack has a goal of being able to slow down
the target server or network,
basically to the point of being unusable.
So the attack vectors typically used are gonna be network,
and that's a DNS amplification attack,
sometimes known as a SMURF attack
or an application level attack where we have HTTP GET
and POST attacks basically, where it floods the server
with so many requests that it exhausts the resources
on the server, effectively bringing it to a screeching halt.
Now, we do have some operational technology mitigations,
such as Web Application Firewalls,
which can help prevent some of that traffic
from getting through.
There are also things like IP reputation databases,
which basically say, hey, if the site coming through
is coming from an IP address
that's not in our reputation database, then allow.
Then we also have a challenge to requestor,
basically a CAPTCHA, which also helps to curb bots
because as at least right now, until AI takes over,
we need a human to actually read that CAPTCHA
for the most part, and enter it in manually
before they're allowed to go on.
