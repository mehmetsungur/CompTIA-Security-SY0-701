When we talk about external audits
and assessments, we have regulatory,
again, GDPR being a big one,
but it's conducted by a government agency
or industry specific regulatory bodies
to assess an organization's compliance with relevant laws,
regulations, and industry standards.
So these examinations may involve assessing an
organization's adherence to data protection laws,
industry specific standards like HIPAA for healthcare
or regional regulations like GDPR in Europe.
So just so you're aware, these types
of examinations are typically mandatory
and non-compliance can result in legal penalties
and also reputational damage.
Along those same lines, examinations are typically performed
by financial institutions
or external agencies to assess the financial health
and compliance of another entity
such as a client or a partner.
Assessments similarly are conducted by external consultants,
experts, or third party organizations
to evaluate specific aspects such as cybersecurity
or operational efficiency or overall compliance.
These type of assessments may include
vulnerability assessments, penetration testing,
and compliance audits to identify vulnerabilities
and weaknesses in an organization's security measures.
And then independent third party audits,
again, conducted by external audit firms
or organizations to provide an impartial evaluation
of an organization's financial statements,
controls, or compliance.
So an organization may seek independent audits
to demonstrate their commitment to security
and compliance, basically to clients, to customers,
and also to regulators.
So each of these things has some common elements,
but understand the nuances.
Some of these are optional.
Some like regulatory assessments are mandatory.
