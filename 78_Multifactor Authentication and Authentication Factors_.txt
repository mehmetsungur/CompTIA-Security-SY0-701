We have the concept
of multifactor authentication.
So two or more pieces of information used to authenticate.
So that could be a PIN,
that could be a password, a fingerprint.
But something to keep in mind,
it must be from different categories.
So a password and a PIN would actually only be one factor
because they both fall under something that you know, right?
You know your password, you know your PIN.
So that's only one factor.
So some examples are different authentication categories.
We have something, you know, which I talked about,
a password or some type of secret, something that you are,
and that could be a fingerprint, a retina scan, et cetera.
Or it could be something that you have.
Could be a smart card, a token, some type
of two factor authentication, something that you carry
with you like a smart card or something
that changes every 60 seconds, like a token and so forth.
Some others are somewhere that you are.
So that could be a location based, an IP address,
geolocation, so on and so forth.
Something that you do, this is something
that's not as common,
but definitely can be a category.
And that could be a signature, a pattern of behavior,
language, slang, so on and so forth.
And then something that you exhibit.
That could be a personality or a neurological trait,
a physical pattern, could be gait analysis,
like how you walk or how you do certain things.
Again, obscure use cases at this point.
But I'm just filling in some of the categories of things
that you could pull from to use two-factor authentication.
This is not all that used, but something to be aware of.
And then also someone that you know,
so it could be social proof, having a friend
or a colleague vouch for the user,
usually via some type of to token generation.
