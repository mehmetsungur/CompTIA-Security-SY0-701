Okay, next up is attestation.
So the key takeaway here
is we're talking about identification.
So the first step in attestation
is to identify all user accounts
and their associated access rights.
This includes user identities, roles, group memberships,
and the resources they can access.
So we do that in a number of ways.
First off is notification.
So the organization notifies the user
of the responsible managers or administrators
about the upcoming attestation process.
So this notification usually includes a list
of their account details and permissions.
So again, when we're talking about attestation,
we're basically saying
"Okay, we need to verify that this person or this entity
or this resource,
and it is what it says it is."
So this is often a bit of a manual process.
Next is review and verification.
So users or their designated reviewers
are asked to review the list of accounts and access rights.
So during this review,
they should confirm that the information is accurate
and up to date,
and if there are discrepancies or unauthorized access,
they can raise flags.
Next is documentation.
So any changes or corrections made
during the attestation process are documented
for auditing purposes.
So that's really the big takeaway here is
all of this is done, obviously, to maintain security,
but it's also there for documentation for auditing purposes.
Next is approval or rejection.
So after the review and any necessary adjustments,
the accounts and the access rights are either approved,
if they're accurate,
or rejected, if they're incorrect or unauthorized.
So this step is crucial for maintaining the integrity
of the identity and access management system.
And then next, periodic recurrence.
So as I mentioned, attestation is not a one-time process.
So it's typically performed periodically.
It could be quarterly, it could be annually,
to ensure that user identities
and access rights remain accurate
and aligned with the organization's policies.
So if you've recently got one,
(laughs) expect to get one again before too long.
And then we can have an automated process as well.
So automated attestation in modern IM systems,
much of that process can be automated.
So these automated tools can generate reports,
they can send notifications,
and in some cases they can even perform some level
of verification, making the process more efficient
and less prone to human error.
But regardless of how it's done in your organization,
make sure that it's followed through,
that it's maintained, and that it's accurate.
