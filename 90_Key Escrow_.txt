So another concept is Key Escrow.
So Key Escrow is a trusted third party
that holds the keys needed to decrypt data,
just like escrow if you're talking about
a mortgage and a third party
or mortgage company
holds some amount of money in escrow
to pay taxes and so forth.
Well, same thing here.
We have a trusted third party
that's holding the keys needed to decrypt data.
So it's used in cases where keys are lost
or some mandate,
I.E, court order,
requires the decryption of that data
so they're holding it in escrow
for if and when needed
often referred to as a fair cryptosystem.
Now, there are some disagreements
around the technical feasibility
of having a trusted third party
correctly managed access to keys
or control collateral compromise
if the keys are leaked,
because as we know, people get hacked,
organizations get hacked,
and if we have a trusted third party,
if that gets leaked, then the confidentiality,
and the security of that entire system
is also compromised.
