Okay, next up, let's talk about encryption.
So we have a few types to talk about.
So we have encryption at rest, which is basically the data
that's sitting on a disk, whether that's a solid state disk
or magnetic, the concept is the same
or encrypting the data that's at rest.
It's sitting on a disk somewhere. Next is in transit.
We would encrypt data being sent from point A to point B.
As it goes onto the wire,
we would use things like IPSec or SSL,
and we would encrypt that communication
so that way it prevents eavesdropping.
If someone were to intercept that communication,
they would not be able to understand what it says.
It would basically just be garbled text,
and then also encryption in memory or encryption in use.
So this is data that's actually being used
by an application and it's sitting in RAM.
So these are three different types of encryption
that can be used or that we should be aware of
and consider when we're designing our systems
and making sure we're securing our infrastructure.
And these can be managed by hardware or by software.
So software, we're talking
about things like BitLocker or VeraCrypt.
There are a number of different tools out there
that can encrypt your data.
It could be at the file level
or it could be at the folder level or volume level,
or you can encrypt an entire disk.
And then we also have hardware,
and we're using things like TPM chips
or HSM modules, which allow us to encrypt
and manage those keys externally in addition
to things like network interface cards
that have IPSec built in
or some type of an encryption algorithm built into the card.
But regardless, whether it's software
or hardware, the concept is the same.
We want to encrypt data to avoid interception,
to avoid eavesdropping, and to keep the data itself secure.
