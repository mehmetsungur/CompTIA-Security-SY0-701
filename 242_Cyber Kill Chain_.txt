Alright, next up, let's talk about something
called the Cyber Kill Chain.
So this was originally developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011,
and it's based on the military concept of a kill chain,
which basically means you're looking for all the things
that an adversary needs to have happen
so they can deliver whatever it is they're trying to do.
So if you understand that chain,
and you stop it at any point along that chain,
then you take away their ability to actually commit
and execute on what they're trying to do.
So let's look through each of these steps.
So first off, we have reconnaissance.
So here the adversary is probing for a weakness.
Harvesting login credentials or info
that can be used in a phishing attack is an example.
From there, we have weaponization.
So in that case, they're actually creating
the deliverable payload using an exploit
and a backdoor, phishing email, what have you.
And then we have delivery, like I said,
actually sending the payload to the victim.
Again, could be a text message, could be a phishing email,
or a piece of malicious code.
Once that's actually delivered, then we have the exploit.
So the exploit means executing code on that remote system.
From there, installation, as you might guess,
which entails installing malware on the target asset,
and then command and control.
So at this point, they're creating a channel
and trying to establish persistence
where the attacker can control the system remotely,
and then whatever actions,
so carrying out the intended goals.
So understanding how these things go
from point A to point B, from really conception to delivery.
If you're able to put controls in place,
whether it's administrative, technical, software,
human intelligence, it could be any number of things.
Social engineering training, phishing training, right?
Don't click on links in emails.
If you're able to break any link in that chain,
you then take away their ability to actually deliver,
act upon the threat.
