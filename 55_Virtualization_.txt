Next, we have the concept of virtualization.
And virtualization is the method of segmenting or isolating.
So what we're doing is keeping a host in a sandbox
or an isolated environment.
So it allows for snapshots, allows us
to quickly revert changes
that also separates guests from the host hypervisor.
So we'll talk more about virtual machines
and the whole process
of virtualization in a different module.
But for now, in the context of security, understand that
by sandboxing, we're basically putting a PC
or an application into a sandbox environment.
We can put guardrails around that.
So it can't talk to other things, it can't talk to the host,
it can't talk to other computers on the network,
potentially, again, depends upon how things are set up,
but allows us to test things
and even allow malware to run as an example.
And we can watch it in a very controlled environment
to see what it does.
And then other devices can also be virtualized as well.
So infrastructure such as routers, switches, load balancers,
firewalls, and so forth.
All of these things have their virtual counterparts as well.
And when we virtualize things, again, we have the ability
to upgrade them, to patch them, to load balance
between them much more efficiently than we would if we had
to physically rack and stack infrastructure.
