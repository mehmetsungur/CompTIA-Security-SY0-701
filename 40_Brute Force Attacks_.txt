Okay, next we have physical attacks
and a few things to cover here.
So first off is a brute force attack.
So what this is, is basically a systematic approach trying
every possible combination of passwords, passphrases,
or encryption keys until you find the ones that work.
So as you can imagine, it's very time consuming.
It's very resource intensive.
But there are some mitigations against this.
By setting up proper technical controls, as an example,
most accounts will lock out after X number of attempts.
So if we have this in place,
this will thwart a brute force attack.
Also, password length
or complexity also can increase the time
that it would take to crack a password.
And another would be MFA or multi-factor authentication,
or in other words, a second form of identification.
So perhaps a password along with a PIN
that's sent to a phone,
something that you know
along with something that you have as an example.
Now, when it comes to actually the things that are needed
for a brute force attack, such things as dictionary attacks
or rainbow table attacks, which we'll talk more about later.
But these things are pretty much a necessity
when we're trying to brute force.
So a dictionary attack we would basically use,
as the name implies, a dictionary,
and go through every single word,
or a rainbow table,
we might hash all of these different things
and then just compare hashes.
So that way time is saved trying to create a hash
for every single possible word.
So if we have a table that's computed ahead of time,
that can save a considerable amount of time and effort.
Again, using these mitigations we just talked about
would help thwart these efforts.
