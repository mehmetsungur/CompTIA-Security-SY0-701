And then a few more tools
that I wanna make sure you're aware of
or a few more concepts rather.
We have just-in-time permissions.
So this is where users are granted temporary access
for a specific task and a period of time.
So this minimizes the exposure of privileged accounts.
Next, we have password vaulting.
So password vaulting is securely storing
and managing privileged account credentials.
So in an enterprise environment,
you might have HashiCorp Vault or CyberArk
or something along those lines
where you have password vaulting
along with privileged access management.
So you can store your credentials there securely.
So your applications and so forth
would then contact the vault to get very secure passwords
and you can have them auto rotate and so forth.
So it makes managing those passwords
and those secrets much, much easier,
and they can even launch ephemeral credentials.
So ephemeral credentials are temporary, short-lived access
tokens that provide access to privileged accounts.
So ephemeral credentials enhance security
by reducing the time during which
credentials can be exploited.
Again, they only last for a short period of time.
They are temporary, they're time-based,
they automatically expire and they're dynamically generated
and not stored on any system.
So again, password vaulting, HashiCorp vault,
and some others can dynamically generate these as well.
So if you haven't looked at these yet, I highly recommend
that you do and see if you can incorporate
those into your systems.
Okay, jam packed module talking about
identity and access management.
A lot of good stuff there, I hope it sunk in.
If not, please go back and rewatch until it sinks in.
Hopefully you can take it back and
incorporate into your organization.
So please stick around because up next we have automation
and orchestration to secure operations.
I'll see you in the next module.
