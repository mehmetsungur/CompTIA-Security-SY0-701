Okay, next up, let's talk about
identity proofing.
And a few things to keep in mind here,
first off, we have verification of identity.
This is basically information required
to establish identity.
So this could include the user's name,
address, date of birth,
and it can range from knowledge-based questions
to more robust or complex forms,
like biometrics, as an example.
Next is authentication methods.
So information required to prove identity.
So that could be something you know,
something you have, or something you are.
And we'll talk more about that in just a moment
when we talk about multifactor authentication.
And then we have risk-based assessment.
So here we assess risk associated with granting access.
In other words, perhaps a user's location,
the device they're using,
a specific behavior, or transaction history.
So based on any or all of those things,
it may trigger additional, what's called step up,
identity verification steps.
Meaning, "Hey, you say you're this,
but we're not quite sure,
or this is a risky behavior, or a risky location,
so we're now going to ask you for a second form,"
maybe a multifactor authentication,
biometric retina scan, security questions, so on, so forth.
And lastly, compliance and regulations.
Regulations like GDPR or HIPAA
often require stringent identity verification steps
to protect sensitive data.
