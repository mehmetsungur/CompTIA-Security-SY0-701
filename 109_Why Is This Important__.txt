So I guess the big question is,
why is all of this important?
Well, design decisions can have security
and also financial implications.
For example, it's much harder to pivot in the future.
If we make a wrong decision in the beginning
and we build an environment on top of that,
it becomes harder to pivot down the road if we decide,
yeah, that really wasn't the best idea
or we should have gone a different way.
so doing your due diligence,
putting some time and effort and thought
into which way you're going to design your network,
the parameters, the processes,
the technologies, and so forth,
all can have a major impact down the road.
So as I mentioned, it's costly to shift to new platforms,
and then it builds an environment, potentially,
again, not always, but potentially,
on insecure or inflexible foundations.
And then lastly, we have things like vendor lock-in,
which may or may not be a big deal,
depending upon your vendor, how much you like them,
how stable and resilient they are,
but if you put all of your eggs in one basket
and that ends up being the wrong basket,
again, it's hard to pivot and take a new direction.
However, if it's designed properly,
some of the benefits include flexibility and agility.
You build in resiliency and security, and also availability.
So all of the things that are a bit of a no-brainer
when we're talking about design,
but again, if you don't do it properly in the beginning,
these things are not guaranteed.
