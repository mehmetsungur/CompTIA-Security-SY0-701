Digging a bit deeper into risk appetite.
So starting off, we have expansionary.
So expansionary, basically, organizations are willing
to take on higher levels of risk.
They prioritize growth
and competitiveness, basically willing
to invest in new ventures or disruptive technologies.
And an example might be a technology startup seeking
rapid growth and expansion.
They may enter emerging markets,
developing cutting edge projects and so forth.
Next, conservative, which is basically the other side
of the coin.
These types of organizations prioritize stability, security,
and preservation of assets.
So they're what you would refer to as risk averse.
So their characteristics, basically,
they emphasize financial security and steady returns,
and they avoid ventures
that could jeopardize financial wellbeing or reputation.
So an example might be a well-established bank
that's focused on stability
and minimizing exposure to financial market volatility.
And then kind of middle of the road, we have neutral.
So organizations that strike a balance
between taking calculated risks
and maintaining a level of caution.
So these types of organizations assess risk on a case
by case basis to make decisions that align
with specific objectives and circumstances.
So flexibility and adaptability are their approach to risk.
And an example might be a diversified conglomerate
that takes calculated risks, again, case by case.
So it takes calculated risks when entering new markets,
but it remains cautious when protecting
its core business segments.
