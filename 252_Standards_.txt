Next, let's talk about standards
just so we're on the same page.
So passwords, which are everyone's favorite thing,
they're there to ensure consistency across the enterprise
and follow best practices.
We need to make sure we're doing that.
And the NIST guide, SP, or special publication, 800-63B
or ISO 27001, provide guidelines
for a password complexity, length, and also storage.
As an example, NIST recommends using long pass phrases
instead of complex passwords.
Also, there are guidelines around access controls.
RBAC, as an example, we talked about this previously,
role-based access control.
This assigns permissions based upon a user's roles
and responsibilities.
FIPS 201,
which is the Federal Information Processing Standard,
this specifies personal identity verification,
or PIV, requirements for access control systems,
which are often used in government and sensitive industries.
And then we have physical security,
again, ISO 27001 or TIA-942,
and TIA is the telecommunications infrastructure standard.
These include requirements related
to physical security controls,
such as access to data centers,
and also protection against environmental threats.
And then encryption.
Again, standards exist to make sure
that we're ensuring algorithms
and implementations are secure and also interoperable.
So things like AES or TLS and SSL are standards
that we have in place to protect data at rest,
in transit, and also over network.
