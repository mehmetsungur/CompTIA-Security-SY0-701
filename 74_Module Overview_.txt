Hey everybody.
Welcome back to Pluralsight.
I'm your instructor, Christopher Reese,
and in this module, we'll be covering
Fundamental Security Concepts.
So let's go ahead and take a look at
what we'll be covering in the module.
We'll talk about such things as non-repudiation.
We'll talk about authentication,
authorization and accounting, or AAA.
We'll talk about something referred to as a Gap analysis,
and then we'll talk about the concept of zero trust,
followed by a couple extra things on physical security,
a little bit of an addendum from our previous module.
And then we'll talk about deception
and disruption technology, such as honeypots,
honeynets, and so forth.
So if we actually break
all of those things down into their sub components,
not to scare you away,
but these are the things
that we'll be covering in this module.
So feel free to pause here
for a moment to read through these things.
And by the end of the module,
these will all make sense to you.
Now, just keep in mind, the physical security section,
we've already covered the first five or six things there
from bollards down to sensors,
but we'll be covering such things as infrared pressure,
microwave and ultrasonic to add
a few more pieces of information to that category.
So with that, let's go ahead and get started.
