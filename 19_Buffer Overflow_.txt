Next we have buffer overflow.
And as you can see from the glass here,
if we have a glass that is full
and we keep adding more and more water
or more and more liquid into that glass,
well eventually it's going to overflow.
So the same thing happens with our buffers.
So an attack that causes a system or an application to crash
or behave unexpectedly.
So writing more data than the buffer can handle,
so it basically becomes full and it overflows.
Data is then written to adjacent memory,
and it basically causes calls or pointers to jump
to a different address than what was intended.
So this can contain executable code,
which could allow for remote code execution.
