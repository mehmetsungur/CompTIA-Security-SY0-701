Next let's talk about the concept of salting.
and this refers to password or passphrase salting.
So it's random data that is used
as an additional input into a one-way function or a hash.
So it defends against things like dictionary attacks
or rainbow table attacks.
By adding some additional information,
that makes it very, very difficult to try and brute force
that specific password or that pass phrase.
So two quick examples. You have user one and user two.
We have assault value, the string to be hashed,
and then the hashed value,
which is a combination of the password
plus the salted value.
So salting something, as I said, adds additional random
or pseudo random information into that password
or that string to be hashed,
which makes it incredibly more difficult to brute force
and crack using conventional methods.
