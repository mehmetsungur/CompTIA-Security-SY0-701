So. when it comes
to anomalous behavior recognition,
so a couple categories.
We have risky behavior.
So, these are basically identifying actions or activities
that pose a significant security risk
to assets, data, or infrastructure.
So, examples might be unauthorized access attempts
or repeated failed login attempts,
downloading large amounts of sensitive data,
or the use of known vulnerable software or configurations.
Then we have unexpected behavior.
So, this is identifying actions or activities
that are not typical or anticipated
within a given system or an environment.
Again, examples.
Accessing systems during non-business hours,
attempting to perform unusual system commands,
engaging activities unrelated to their roles,
logging in from unusual locations.
All of these things are not necessarily indicative
of malicious intent or malicious behavior,
but they should at least raise some flags
and warrant further investigation.
And then we have unintentional behavior,
so actions or activities that occur
due to human error or accidental actions
rather than really malicious intent.
So again, some examples might be misconfigurations,
accidental data deletions,
sending sensitive information to the wrong recipients,
or unintentionally clicking on phishing links.
And if your organization has a phishing campaign test
or some type of awareness training,
you might be surprised
how many people actually click on phishing links,
so the more you do those tests
and the more you reinforce that with your end users,
you're building some muscle memory, if you will,
and it helps to keep that in the front of their mind
so they don't inadvertently click on these types of links
in the future.
