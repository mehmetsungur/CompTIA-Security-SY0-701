Next is the concept of privilege escalation.
And with this, we're obtaining elevated privileges,
I.e. an administrator or a root, on a target system,
right, on the victim.
So there are a number of ways to accomplish this.
We can do something called dumping the SAM,
or the security accounts manager, right,
which is the local accounts file on that machine.
We can retrieve the /etc/passwd file
if we're a Linux box.
The SAM file pertains to Windows boxes.
The /etc/passwd file pertains to Linux boxes.
We can also look for insecure file shares.
We can do something called DLL pre-loading
and also look for insecure or weak security on processes.
Again, we talked a little bit about process injection
and so forth earlier, DLL injection and so forth.
So many vulnerabilities enable an attacker
to gain system-level permissions.
And the sad or, perhaps, the scary part is,
there are new ways being developed every day.
