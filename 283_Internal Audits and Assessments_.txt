So when we're talking about
internal audits and assessments,
we're meaning activities focused on
helping an organization enhance their operations,
their risk management processes,
and also compliance with policies and regulations.
So compliance audits ensure an organization adheres
to external regulations, internal policies,
and, of course, industry-specific standards.
And this can mean following security policies,
data protection measures, and maintaining the integrity
and confidentiality of sensitive information.
So regular internal checks help identify areas
where an organization may be falling short
of its own standards,
which is critical for maintaining
that robust security posture.
Another component is an audit committee.
So this is responsible for overseeing
the internal audit function
and also ensures that it operates
effectively and independently.
So these things can be financial audits,
operational or compliance audits,
and, many times, it primarily focuses on financial matters.
Its oversight can also extend to cybersecurity,
especially in cases where security breaches
could have significant financial
or reputational implications.
So again, the audit committee ensures audits
are conducted impartially, most importantly,
that the findings are addressed appropriately,
and ultimately promoting transparency and accountability.
So internal evaluations conducted by an organization
to evaluate its own processes, controls, and performance.
So when it comes to cybersecurity,
self-assessments involve evaluating the effectiveness
of security controls, risk management,
and overall adherence to security policies.
So self-assessments can
and really should be conducted regularly
to proactively address security gaps
and ensure ongoing compliance.
