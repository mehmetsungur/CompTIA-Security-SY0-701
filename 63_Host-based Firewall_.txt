Next, we have a host-based firewall,
and firewalls, as you may be familiar,
typically block traffic based on a port, a protocol,
an IP address, or an application,
so, host-based firewalls, as you might guess,
protect a single host only, so they're not network-based.
And this is usually done by restricting applications,
and as mentioned previously,
applications can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.
So, host-based firewalls, again, are host-specific.
They're not as robust as a network-based.
They only protect that single host on a network,
so unless you're in a very small shop
where you're doing something very specific
for a single application,
it's generally a better idea to have larger,
more robust firewalls at the perimeter of your network,
and potentially inside of your network
if you're in a very highly-secure environment,
or you wanna keep one domain
or one section of your network separated from the other.
