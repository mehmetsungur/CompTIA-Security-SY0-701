When it comes to development
and execution of training,
we wanna make sure we're setting the proper culture.
And culture is really the set of shared attitudes,
values, goals, and practices
that characterizes an institution or organization.
So when creating that culture, you may say,
"Okay, well, where do I start?"
Well, we wanna make sure we focus on the weakest links.
And again, individuals, not being derogatory,
but they are the weak link
in that they have access to business systems,
computers, networks, potentially sensitive data,
and it's quite possible they can unintentionally weaken
those systems by not doing things properly.
Enable executives, managers,
and individual contributors to all share,
learn from one another's personal experiences,
and also understand each other's needs.
And then also ensure the training is timely, relevant,
and, of course, interactive.
Engaging training that is applicable to a person's job
or function is much more likely to be interesting,
memorable, and, of course, actionable.
When it comes to awareness training,
we need to make sure we understand
who is the intended audience.
Is it key groups or company-wide?
Is it internal only or suppliers or key customers?
And then also the methods of delivery,
whether it's posters, swag, company intranet,
it could be newsletters, et cetera.
And then also understand what the expected outcomes are.
What is the success criteria?
So again, you may or may not be responsible for training.
You may be the recipient of that training,
but it's always a good idea
to make sure you have these things in mind
so that you're tailoring the message
so that you can then provide proper feedback
to enhance the training and make it better going forward.
