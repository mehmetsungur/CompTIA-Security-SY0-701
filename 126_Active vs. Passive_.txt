So let's talk about device attributes.
And this is in the context of scanning
or actually attaching to the network, trying to do some type
of reconnaissance or even just monitoring on the network.
So active and passive, so active is potentially intrusive.
It's more easily detected, and it takes some type of action.
So if it detects something, it will act upon it.
Passive monitors are typically non-intrusive.
They can alert, but they typically don't take
any type of action,
so they kind of just watch things go by if you will.
Much harder to detect.
If someone kicks off a massive port scan in your network,
you are gonna have security tools in place
that will detect that port scan.
So those things are easier to actually identify.
But passive pen testing reconnaissance
is actually much harder to identify.
