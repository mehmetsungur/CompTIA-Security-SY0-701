Okay, next,
we have something called tokenization.
And tokenization is replacing sensitive data
with a non-sensitive equivalent.
So it can be single use, multiple use,
it can be cryptographic or non-cryptographic,
it could be also reversible or irreversible, right?
So how's that for covering all the bases?
So we have two main types.
We have HVTs, or high-value tokens,
and they can be used to replace things
like primary account numbers, or PANs,
on credit card transactions,
and it can be bound to specific devices, and so forth.
And then we have low-value tokens
that can serve a similar function,
but it needs the underlying tokenization system
to match it back to the actual primary account number,
or the PAN.
So a tokenization example.
So here we have a customer,
and basically the customer makes a purchase, right?
So that token goes to the merchant,
the merchant passes that token along
to the merchant acquirer.
From there, the merchant acquirer passes that token
to the network.
From there, the token vault is consulted to match the token
with the customer account number.
The network passes the token
and the primary account number to the actual bank.
The bank verifies the funds and authorizes the transaction,
and then sends that back, the info back through the network,
the acquirer, and the merchant to complete the transaction.
So it's a complicated process,
and typically when you tap your card
or insert into the point of sale terminal,
all of this happens very, very quickly,
but it's basically passing that information all the way down
through this network to the bank and back again
in relatively short order.
