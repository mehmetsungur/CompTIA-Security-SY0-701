We also need to make sure we identify
the rules of engagement.
So clearly define processes, expectations,
acceptable use, behavior, and so forth.
So this includes the scope of the engagement, limitations,
any type of security assessments,
also legal and regulatory considerations
along with audit and reporting requirements,
what types of audits, how often, what format and so forth.
Identify success criteria, if appropriate.
What defines success or what defines failure?
And then communication.
How's it gonna be done, frequency,
what distributions are used,
what methods are used, Slack channel, Teams, Zoom,
email, what have you.
Are there daily stand ups, weekly meetings,
bi-weekly, so on and so forth.
All of these things should be called out
and defined ahead of time.
So if we do all of these things, best practices in place,
make sure our vendors are adhering to the same principles
and the same processes that we do internally,
then it goes a long way to helping
to strengthen our security posture.
Alrighty, short and sweet with that one.
Third party risk assessment and management, though,
is very important.
So I wanna make sure you don't underestimate the importance.
A lot of breaches and a lot of security incidents
have happened because of third party vendors,
security practices are not up to snuff
or something wasn't done correctly,
or for whatever reason, they were hacked,
and it basically opens up a side door to the target company.
So obviously I don't want that to happen to you
or your company.
So make sure you really follow the information here,
do your due diligence,
and make sure your vendors have your best interest at heart.
So hopefully that was informative for you, but stick around
because up next we'll be talking about effective
security compliance.
I'll see you in the next module.
