Okay, next let's talk about
the concept of hashing.
So hashing is a mathematical algorithm applied to a file
before and after transmission
or before and after data collection
if we're doing forensics and things like that.
But it's basically verifying the veracity of a file
or a volume or partition or a disc.
So if anything within the file changes,
then the hash will be completely different.
And we have things like MD5, SHA1, SHA1.
There's a number of different hashing algorithms.
An example would be using SHA1.
For instance, if I went in and said,
all right, Pluralsight is really
the best training on the planet, right,
and I put that into a file,
I would get this specific result.
If I change one thing and I simply take away
that exclamation point at the end of the sentence
and I run the same hash again,
you'll notice the resulting hash is completely different.
So that can be done on a file, a volume, or an entire disc.
If one tiny piece of information changes,
the hash is completely different.
So it allows us to say, without a doubt, yes,
the information before and after is exactly the same.
We could hash the information before we send it,
and the recipient could run the same hash once they get it.
And if they match up, they know it was not tampered with.
Same thing if we're doing forensics
and we wanna say, "Hey, the drive I just collected,
I'm gonna run a hash on that drive
before I do anything with it."
And then once we go through all of our process,
evidence collection and so forth,
now I have to take it to court,
I could run that same hash again.
If those hash values match, then we can say conclusively
there's been no tampering with that drive
throughout that process.
