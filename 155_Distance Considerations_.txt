And then when it comes to backups,
there's also some distance considerations.
So backups versus high availability.
So backups can be geographically far away
because they're asynchronous,
versus high availability, which requires synchronous.
So when it comes to backups,
there really is no distance constraints.
If you want to have things be highly available
and synchronous replication,
basically meaning almost real time,
then you do have potentially some distance constraints.
Backups do not have that.
However, some things to consider,
physical backup distance limitations.
How long would it take to get tapes back
in the event of a disaster?
Are they across the street, perhaps another state,
or perhaps across the country?
So those things need to be considered as well.
And then recovery testing, whether it's a hot, warm,
or cold site, the time required to recover offsite backups,
the order of recovery, app consistent,
crash consistent, and so forth.
All of these things should be tested
so that you fully understand and have realistic expectations
of how long it's gonna take to actually recover something.
