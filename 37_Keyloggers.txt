Next we have the concept of a keylogger,
and the keylogger, as I mentioned briefly with spyware
is a piece of malicious software or malicious application
that once installed on a host can capture all keystrokes,
so that means usernames and passwords.
It could be sensitive information, emails, chats,
instant messages, pretty much everything.
And from there, those captured files can be uploaded
to a remote location, emailed or stored locally
for later retrieval.
So just for the distinction,
all spyware doesn't contain keyloggers, but some do.
And a keylogger, like I said will capture that information
and make it available to the bad actor,
whether it's remotely uploaded
or they have access to it physically.
Spyware on the other hand, as I mentioned,
can contain a keylogger,
but sometimes it's there just to gather information
about a user's habits, what websites they visit
and so forth so they can then serve up ads or entice a user
to take some type of action.
