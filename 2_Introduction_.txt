Hey, everybody, welcome back.
This is course number two in our series,
and we're covering threats, vulnerabilities,
and mitigations for CompTIA Security+.
In this module,
we'll be talking about common threat actors and motivations.
And as always, I'm your instructor, Christopher Rees.
So let's go ahead and jump
into what we'll covering in this module.
We'll be talking about threat actors, the various types,
including nation state, unskilled attacker,
formerly known as script kiddies.
We'll talk about hacktivists, also, insider threats,
organized crime, shadow IT,
and of course, the various attributes of actors,
like internal versus external,
resources and funding,
levels sophistication and capabilities,
because this will drastically vary from group to group.
Also, motivations, what drives these folks,
whether it's data exfiltration, it could be espionage,
service disruption, blackmail, financial gain,
philosophical or political beliefs,
could be ethical, also, revenge, or disruption in chaos.
And then lastly, war.
So let's go ahead and get started and dig right in.
