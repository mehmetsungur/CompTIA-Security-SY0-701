Okay, so let's go ahead
and walk through some of the scenarios.
So, the first one is unauthorized access attempt.
So, here's the scenario.
A user reports that they couldn't access their account
and they suspect some type of hacking attempt.
So, we have an unhappy user here.
So, what data sources could we use for that?
As we go through these, you may wanna pause the video
and ask the question for yourself before you see the answer
about what type of data sources could be used?
Well, data sources could be firewall logs, application logs,
could also be OS-specific security logs,
and then network logs.
And then how we would use those
would be basically analyze firewall logs
for any unusual incoming traffic,
we could review application logs for login attempts,
also check OS security logs for failed login attempts,
and basically we're looking for the source
of the unauthorized access attempt.
So, some of the tools you might use,
and again, as I go through these,
I'm not recommending one over the other.
These are just some of the more popular tools
that you may have in your environment,
and most if not all of the tools that are mentioned here,
we have training and/or labs within Pluralsight,
that you can dig deeper into each of these.
Going into the actual inner workings of them
is beyond the scope of this course,
but I would definitely encourage you
to dig deeper into each of these tools,
look at some of the training available at Pluralsight,
and dig deeper where you can.
So anyway, so some of the tools
would be our SIEM systems, right?
Security information and event management.
So, we have solutions like Splunk.
We could also use ELK Stack or Qradar,
and these can centralize and analyze logs
from various sources.
We can also utilize network intrusion detection systems,
or NIDS,
such as Snort,
and that can help to detect suspicious traffic.
Next one, malware infection.
All right, so the scenario.
A computer in the network is behaving strangely
and we suspect a malware infection.
So, what data sources will we use?
Well, we can use endpoint logs, network logs,
and then OS-specific security logs,
and we'd use them by examining endpoint logs
for unusual processes or system behavior,
review network logs for suspicious outbound connections,
and check OS logs for any signs of malware execution
or unauthorized system changes.
Some of the tools you may use for that
would be endpoint detection and response, or EDR, solutions
like CrowdStrike or Carbon Black,
which can provide real-time monitoring
and response capabilities.
Also, network traffic analysis tools like Wireshark
can also be used for packet capture analysis.
Next, we have data exfiltration.
So, the scenario here,
we have sensitive company data
that appears to have been leaked or stolen.
So, what data sources might we look at here?
Well, we can check out network logs, metadata,
and also packet captures.
So, various uses.
We would analyze network logs for unusual data transfers,
we would review metadata for file access history,
and also examine packet captures
to trace the path of the exfiltrated data
and hopefully identify the responsible parties.
So, some tools that we could possibly use
might be DLP, or data loss prevention, solutions,
like Semantic DLP, or also McAfee DLP.
Both of those can monitor
and also prevent unauthorized data transfers.
We can also use network forensic tools like Zeek,
formerly known as Bro,
which can aid in analyzing packet captures.
Next, a brute force attack.
All right, this scenario here.
Frequent login attempts on a critical server,
so we suspect someone's trying to brute force their way in.
Well, data sources could be application logs,
OS-specific security logs.
Again, hopefully you're seeing the importance
of making sure you're logging properly.
So, uses could be investigating application logs
for repeated login failures.
We can also check OS logs
for failed authentication attempts,
and then review our IDS or IPS logs
for any alerts related to suspicious login activity.
Some tools you might use would be IDS systems
like Snort or Suricata,
which can generate alerts for suspicious login attempts.
We can also look at the authentication logs
from platforms like Windows Event Logs
or our Linux auth logs, which can be reviewed.
Next, a software vulnerability exploitation.
So, a known software vulnerability
is being actively exploited in the environment.
So, what data sources might we use
to aid in our investigation?
Well, vulnerability scans, automated reports,
and dashboards.
So, some potential uses.
We would review vulnerability scan reports
to identify affected systems,
we could also analyze automated reports
for exploitation attempts,
and then also use dashboards
to monitor ongoing attempts and response efforts.
Some tools you may use
would be a vulnerability assessment tools,
such as Nessus or OpenVAS,
which can identify vulnerable systems.
Security dashboards within our SIEM platforms
can also provide real-time visibility
into vulnerability exploitation attempts.
Next, we have an insider threat,
apparently a very well-dressed insider threat,
and here the scenario is suspicion of an insider threat
leaking confidential information.
So, some data sources we might use are, again,
metadata, endpoint logs, and network logs.
So, some of the uses might be examining metadata
to track file access and changes,
review endpoint logs for user activities,
and analyze network logs
to see if any unusual data transfers or connections
correlate with the suspected insider's actions.
Some tools that may help us
are file integrity monitoring tools like Tripwire or OSSEC,
which can detect unauthorized changes to files,
user and entity behavior analytics platforms
like Exabeam or Splunk User Behavior Analytics
can also help identify insider threats.
And then we have a phishing attack.
So, in this scenario, employees receive suspicious emails
and you suspect a phishing campaign.
So, some data sources we may use,
email logs, IDS and IPS logs,
and then also application logs.
So, in using that, we would analyze email logs
for patterns of phishing emails,
we could check IDS and IPS logs for any related alerts,
and review application logs
to see if any users clicked on malicious links
or downloaded attachments.
So, some tools we may use for that
would be email security solutions
like Proofpoint or Mimecast,
which can provide email filtering and analytics.
We could also use our WAFs, or web application firewalls,
like ModSecurity,
which can help protect against web-based phishing attempts.
Alrighty, so that wraps up this module.
Hopefully you found it useful and informative
and you understand the importance
of proper data collection and logging.
So, that brings us to the end of this course,
but stick around, because up next is our domain summary.
